"Accurate water resource predictions are critical for the nation’s water security, especially during extreme events. Today, communities are experiencing increasingly frequent floods and droughts, heat waves, and wildfires, all of which will impact vegetation behaviors and drive land use/cover changes. As such, predicting the resulting impacts on water budget components is fundamental to enhancing the nation’s preparedness for water-related hazards and water scarcity under a changing climate. However, virtually all land models ignore a substantial volume of plant-available water stored in unsaturated, weathered bedrock. This oversight can lead to biased predictions of ecosystem water consumption and downstream water budget components, jeopardizing the nation’s water-food-energy security. The research objective of this proposed project will be to directly address this knowledge gap by implementing an innovative approach within the Community Land Model Version 5 (CLM5) to represent vegetation's uptake of rock moisture and subsequently evaluate its impact on water budget simulations across the continental U.S. (CONUS). This fellowship will enable the PI to establish a mentor-mentee relationship with Dr. Sean Swenson, a prominent hydrologist and core developer of CLM5, and to receive specialized training and access to state-of-the-art land modeling equipment at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).<br/><br/>Specifically, the PI proposes that modeling plant access to rock moisture will refine simulations of water budget dynamics. To investigate this hypothesis, the PI will visit NCAR for two summers, where Dr. Swenson will mentor the PI in advanced techniques for modifying land models, focusing on CLM5—a leading-edge land model widely used to study the role of land in climate and weather. To enable vegetation water uptake from the weathered bedrock layer, this fellowship project will truncate the root profile by the position of the unweathered bedrock, which will stimulate root growth into the hydrologically active bedrock layer and account for the ability of the vegetation to extract water stored in weathered bedrock. The team will run the original CLM5 and the rock moisture configuration with the same forcing data. Then, they will compare the performance of the two models, assessed by their accuracy in simulating observations of evapotranspiration and streamflow, as well as their responses to climatic extremes. This collaborative endeavor will advance the understanding of land-atmosphere interactions and improve the predictive capabilities of land models, ultimately contributing to more accurate assessments of water availability and environmental resilience across the CONUS. The broader impacts of this fellowship will be further extended through installing CLM5 on Idaho’s supercomputer, organizing a workshop for academic professionals and students, and crafting a hands-on CLM5 course. Together, these efforts will enhance Idaho’s hydroclimate modeling infrastructure, enhance research capabilities, empower STEM researchers and students, and elevate Idaho’s standing in national research endeavors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.083,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,300000.00,300000,4900,EPSCoR RII Track-4: Res Fellow,2429739,,Meng Zhao,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,mengz@uidaho.edu,Meng,Zhao,bjmccall@nsf.gov,Benjamin J.

"Commercial semiconductor chips and their packages are designed to work at temperatures up to 250℃. They will fail to work after a few hours at temperatures above this threshold. In recent years, research has been conducted to develop special chips made of different semiconductor materials that can operate in harsh environments for long durations, up to a year. This project aims to address the challenges of integrating and packaging chips made from different semiconductor materials that can operate flawlessly at high temperatures for months. The goal is to create a package where the chips can continue to work for extended periods at temperatures up to 600℃. This microelectronic system in a package will find broad applications in electric suspension and brakes of electric vehicles, turbine engine sensing and control systems, deep-well drilling telemetry, and Venus and Mercury exploration, where temperatures far exceed 250℃. The technology and management skills gained during this NSF Research Fellowship at Georgia Tech, the host site, will help the principal investigator lead the effort to revitalize semiconductor education and research at the University of Idaho, meeting the workforce needs of the semiconductor manufacturing reshoring to the U.S. in the coming decades.<br/><br/>In the realm of electronics, the pursuit of devices capable of enduring extreme temperatures has led to significant interest in wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors. These materials, known for their ability to operate in harsh environments, are pivotal in advancing compact electronic systems for specialized applications. However, a key challenge lies in the efficient integration of chips fabricated from various WBG materials onto one substrate. This integration is crucial for the development of robust electronic systems that can withstand high-temperature conditions. Addressing these challenges requires specialized knowledge and training in advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques. The proposed project aims to enable the Principal Investigator (PI) to receive specialized training and access to state-of-the-art semiconductor fabrication and packaging facilities at Georgia Tech. The project focuses on investigating the integration and packaging of chips and sensors based on different WBG semiconductor materials such as silicon carbide (SiC), gallium nitride (GaN), and diamond for extremely high-temperature (up to 600°C) applications. The PI has been working on the high-temperature 3D packaging of SiC chips for three years. Dr. C. P. Wong, the primary research collaborator at Georgia Tech, specializes in packaging material synthesis and characterizations, especially flip-chip underfill, an essential part of the proposed research. After the completion of the project, the PI will continue collaborating with the faculty at Georgia Tech, obtain research funds in this advanced packaging area, and expand the University of Idaho’s research and education capability for semiconductor workforce training.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.083,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,299938.00,299938,4900,EPSCoR RII Track-4: Res Fellow,2429402,,Feng Li,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,fengli@uidaho.edu,Feng,Li,pbentzvi@nsf.gov,Pinhas Ben-Tzvi,7032928246,['01002425DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],09/10/2024,01/01/2025,12/31/2026,EPSCoR Research Fellows: NSF: Heterogeneous Integration of Wide Bandgap Semiconductor Chips for High Temperature Applications,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,,
"Changing climates are a major challenge for humans and nature. One of the most important scientific questions of the 21st century is ""What will determine the vulnerability of species and biological communities to environmental disruption?"" Addressing this question, however, is extremely challenging because changes in climate are complex, evolutionary history will determine species' sensitivity, and species' responses will be affected by the complex food webs of which they are a part. For example, even if a predator species is relatively insensitive to warming temperatures, it may still be vulnerable if the prey species it feeds on are sensitive and disappear. The research team will investigate thermal vulnerabilities of cutthroat trout predators and tailed frog tadpole prey in mountain streams of the U.S. Pacific Northwest using a multidisciplinary approach that combines cutting-edge DNA sequencing technology, physiology experiments, and high-performance computer modeling. This is an excellent predator-prey case study to investigate this question, as cutthroat trout are important predators of tailed frog tadpoles, both species are cold-water specialists that are sensitive to warming, and both species are of conservation concern. Thus, results of this study will be important for informing their conservation and management. The research team will work closely with federal and state natural resource agencies to make sure that results are useful for informing decisions about the conservation and management of stream biodiversity. The team will develop a web-based tool to help managers assess environmental vulnerabilities. The project will also provide training for four early career researchers. <br/><br/><br/>It is essential to integrate organismal, ecological, and evolutionary perspectives to predict the vulnerability of species and biological communities to global change. The proposed research will use a highly interdisciplinary approach to test several novel hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying environmental vulnerability in a predator (cutthroat trout) - prey (tailed frog) system in streams of the U.S. Pacific Northwest. In Aim 1, the research team will test whether predators (cutthroat trout) are more sensitive to increasing temperatures than their prey (tailed frogs) using a combination of environmental characterization, genomics, and physiology to quantify thermal adaptation. In Aim 2, they will test whether different dimensions of adaptive capacity (dispersal, evolutionary potential, and acclimation ability) differ between predators and prey by using genomics to characterize patterns and rates of connectivity across the landscape and evolutionary potential, and physiology to quantify acclimation. In Aim 3, the team will determine how predator-prey interactions respond to temperature and flow by quantifying the diet of cutthroat trout and energy content of tailed frogs, and by using a mechanistic food web model to predict how climate change-driven changes in energy flow and food web dynamics will affect cutthroat trout-tailed frog interactions. In Aim 4, they will integrate the results from Aims 1-3 using an individual-based, eco-evolutionary model to predict how species interactions, intraspecific variation in sensitivity, and adaptive capacity act synergistically to determine spatial patterns of thermal vulnerability in cutthroat trout and tailed frogs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,644970.00,202860,4900,ORCC-Organism Resp Clim Change,2413361,,Paul A Hohenlohe,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,hohenlohe@uidaho.edu,Paul,Hohenlohe,dkabbot@nsf.gov,Patrick Abbot,7032924740,['01002425DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/19/2024,12/01/2024,11/30/2027,Collaborative Research: ORCC: Integrating evolutionary adaptive capacity and trophic dynamics to predict multi-species responses to climate change,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['James J Nagler', 'Alexandra K Fraik']",A,,
"Climate change is one of the greatest threats to the sustainability of food and fiber production and rural communities. However, there is potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land management practices that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in forests and soils. These land management practices create more resilient, climate-smart rural communities. This project leverages the natural resources of Idaho and Montana to research and implement climate-smart forestry and agricultural solutions.  The team will implement these practices in both jurisdictions to 1) fully study the carbon and climate impacts of the practices, 2) research the social barriers to implementation of these practices, and 3) determine the economic impacts of the adoption of these practices on rural and tribal communities. The project's aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while partnering with local communities and tribes to effectively promote community resilience and adaptation to climate change. The team's activities and results will enhance the climate change resilience of their partnering rural and tribal communities, contribute to the creation of a diverse STEM workforce, and produce measurable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. This work will offer policymakers in Idaho, Montana, and other rural, western states a road map for successful, locally supported climate-smart infrastructure implementation.<br/><br/>Anthropogenic climate change has led to increasingly negative events impacting rural Idaho and Montana. These events include intensifying wildfires and persistent drought that are decreasing both ecological and community resilience. Climate smart land management solutions offer a path to both climate benefits and increased ecological and community resilience. Through new and existing partnerships between the University of Idaho, the University of Montana, the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, and Salish Kootenai Tribal College, the team will implement climate smart land management practices in forests and farms in the region. The team will quantify the ecological, social, and economic impacts of the implemented solutions. Through this interdisciplinary and community-based effort the team will provide: 1) improved knowledge on the efficacy and biogeochemical impacts of potential climate-smart management solutions, 2) novel, state-of-the-art methods for quantifying and predicting carbon storage potential (including field-based sample collection and process-based ecosystem modeling) for individual regions, 3) training and education programs for undergraduate, graduate, and early career scientists, including tailored recruitment and retention activities for underrepresented groups in STEM, 4) models for effective partnerships with practitioners and communities, 5) integration of Traditional Knowledge with Western Sciences, and 6) pathways that reduce barriers and risks identified by underserved and minority populations to adopt and implement climate-smart land management solutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.083,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,2999956.00,1508247,4900,EPSCoR RII Track-2 FEC,2418257,,Tara Hudiburg,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,thudiburg@uidaho.edu,Tara,Hudiburg,bjmccall@nsf.gov,Benjamin J.

"Transitioning from high school to university presents various challenges for first-year engineering students, particularly as they adapt from a high school mindset to the rigors of higher education. These challenges are not just academic; they include social issues, the need for independent study, cognitive adjustments, and demanding coursework. Research has shown that certain social factors play critical roles in helping students navigate this transition successfully. These social factors include engineering identity, sense of belonging, and self-efficacy, all of which are essential for students to feel integrated and competent in their new academic environments. The COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated the educational landscape, prompting the creation of diverse learning environments to cater to the varied needs of students. These environments range from fully online formats, asynchronous and synchronous, to hybrid models, combining online and in-person instruction, such as HyFlex formats. The HyFlex model, in particular, offers a blend of hybrid and flexible learning, allowing synchronous participation both online and in person. Despite the proliferation of these innovative learning models, there is little research on how the HyFlex format impacts student learning and engagement in engineering education compared to traditional in-person methods. In response to this gap in research, a quasi-experimental study is proposed to assess the efficacy of the HyFlex learning environment within the context of drone education at a rural public university.<br/><br/>The project will involve a new course titled ""iDrone 101,"" which will be available in both HyFlex and traditional in-person formats for first-year engineering students at the University of Idaho. This course aims to provide students with foundational knowledge in automatic control, sensors, ground robots, and drones. Moreover, it will seek to integrate students' cultural experiences and values into problem-solving exercises that address real-world issues, such as wildfire monitoring, river restoration, and animal migration. The overarching goal of this project is to explore how the HyFlex model influences student perceptions and behaviors concerning emerging technologies when compared to a conventional in-person classroom setting. The research objectives include (a) increasing student engagement with emerging technologies through the ""iDrone 101"" courses, (b) fostering positive attitudes towards engineering, reflecting strengthened engineering identity, enhanced sense of belonging, and increased self-efficacy, and (c) evaluating the specific impacts of the HyFlex learning environment relative to the traditional in-person format. The mixed-methods research from quantitative and qualitative methods including pre-post surveys and semi-structured interviews with a particular focus on underrepresented students, will evaluate the influence of HyFlex and in-person learning on students' perceptions and behaviors, regarding rapidly advancing technologies, particularly autonomous unmanned vehicles, including unmanned aerial vehicles (e.g., drones), unmanned ground vehicles (e.g., ground robots), and unmanned surface vehicles (e.g., drone boats). This project is designed to be easily scalable and implementable. Therefore, the HyFlex and in-person learning modules developed for the iDrone 101 course curricula from this project will be available to a broader audience across different states through the project's website.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,169888.00,169888,4900,EngEd-Engineering Education,2406953,,Jae Ryu,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,jryu@uidaho.edu,Jae,Ryu,ddenick@nsf.gov,Dana L.

"Seismic mapping of Earth’s lowermost mantle reveals the presence of at least two continent-sized structures located just above the outer-core within the mantle. Due to these structures slow seismic wave speeds, they are commonly referred to as Large Low Velocity Provinces (LLVPs). LLVPs potentially influence deep-Earth dynamics, alter lower mantle circulation, decrease core heat flow, and consequently modify the planet’s magnetic field. The extent of these potential impacts depends on LLVP material properties, including their composition and density, among others. However, current geophysical methods do not directly measure composition and density. To address this, this project will leverage low-mass, elementary particles called neutrinos that have direct sensitivity to the composition and density of matter using a technique known as Neutrino Oscillation Tomography of the Earth (NOTE). The NOTE method can infer properties of the lower mantle by analyzing the characteristics of Earth-crossing neutrinos arriving at a detector (e.g., angles of arrival, energies, and neutrino types). To enhance the sensitivity of NOTE and complement existing geophysical methods, the researchers will create a new NOTE framework capable of integrating data from multiple neutrino detectors into a single analysis, providing new, independent estimates of the composition and density of LLVP. With several neutrino detectors online or in development, this project will develop tools to harness their collective capabilities, while also leveraging existing geophysical data toward new breakthroughs in understanding our planet. The goal is to build the tools necessary to demonstrate that with the use of multiple detectors, NOTE can provide a robust determination of LLSVP density and composition within a decade. This project will establish and strengthen international collaboration, while providing and training and mentoring for students, and facilitating outreach opportunities.<br/><br/>The composition and density of an LLVP impact its viscosity and relative buoyancy, thereby governing its dynamic behavior and lifetime in the mantle. By developing a new tool to constrain the density and composition of LLVPs, this project will open new approaches for exploring the Earth’s deep interior. The researchers will create a novel multi-detector framework for NOTE and integrate it with existing geophysical constraints, yielding a unified method for estimating LLSVP properties. The project has three primary objectives: 1) incorporate multiple detectors into the NOTE code EarthProbe, 2) systematically assess the sensitivity of multi-detector NOTE to LLVP properties, and 3) integrate geophysical constraints into the proposed framework to improve data statistics and decrease required data collection times. To achieve Objective 1, the project team will modify the EarthProbe code and data structures to account for neutrinos arriving at multiple detectors, as well as the covariance matrix used by existing minimization algorithms to yield estimates of LLVP properties. Objective 2 will be accomplished through a series of systematic sensitivity tests of the new multi-detector framework across a range of anomalous LLSVP densities and compositional contrasts. Finally, for Objective 3, the team will incorporate existing geophysical estimates of either composition or density to quantify any reduction in data collection period required for NOTE analysis. This project will establish and strengthen international collaboration with a PhD student at the center, while providing and training and mentoring for students, and facilitate outreach opportunities.

"This research explores the world of chemical communication among land snails forming communities in the Peruvian Andes, an area particularly rich in biodiversity. Chemical interactions, such as those mediated by snail mucus, are crucial yet understudied components of community assembly and biodiversity. By focusing on the chemical properties of snail mucus, the project aims to uncover how these traits related to communication between organisms influence species interactions, which in turn are shaping the assembly of biological communities. This study is addressing an important gap in knowledge by merging the fields of chemical ecology and evolutionary biology to better understand how species interact and coexist at a local scale. Understanding species interactions is crucial for biodiversity conservation, as it can reveal how species adapt to their environments and maintain stable communities, especially in the face of environmental changes. The project will support educational workshops for undergraduates and early graduate students in the USA and Peru, emphasizing research skills and leadership, particularly for participants from underrepresented groups, thereby fostering a diverse scientific community and international collaborations.<br/><br/>This project integrates chemical ecology, phylogenetics, and morphometrics to quantify chemical (mucus), morphological (shell), and genetic (DNA) variation in Andean land snails and how this variation contributes to community assembly and species diversification. In particular, using mass spectrometry and proteomics, the research will identify and quantify mucus components across different snail species. Phylogenetic analyses will be conducted to understand the evolutionary relationships among these species, while morphometric techniques will assess shell characteristics. Together, these approaches aim to test hypotheses regarding the role of mucus in species recognition and community dynamics, providing insights into the mechanisms of species coexistence, competition, and ecological adaptation. By combining these interdisciplinary approaches, the research seeks to advance our understanding of the chemical basis of species interactions and its impact on community structure and evolution. Ultimately the research will provide insights into the mechanisms driving community dynamics and species diversification in this biodiversity hotspot, and serve as a model to understand these processes in other systems. <br/><br/>The award is co-funded by the Population and Community Ecology program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,277923.00,277923,4900,Evolutionary Processes,2423020,,Christine E Parent,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,ceparent@uidaho.edu,Christine,Parent,sscheine@nsf.gov,Samuel Scheiner,7032927175,['01002425DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/01/2024,07/01/2024,06/30/2027,MCA: Species Diversification and Community Assembly in Andean Land Snails,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,E,,
"This project is jointly funded by the Division of Physics Gravitational Physics program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). This award brings high-fidelity binary black hole (BBH) simulations, traditionally the domain of supercomputing, into the realm of consumer-grade hardware, greatly broadening participation in this scientific research. BlackHoles@Home (BH@H) implements innovative computational techniques to reduce memory and computational demands by 40 to 100 times, making it possible to perform these simulations on everyday computers. As a result, this project deepens our understanding of BBH mergers, the most frequently observed sources of gravitational waves. By democratizing access to this technology, BH@H promotes the progress of science, enabling a diverse group of students, educators, and researchers to engage in gravitational wave source modeling irrespective of their resources. Additionally, its integration into a public volunteer computing effort supports the national interest by engaging the public in scientific discovery and providing educational tools that demystify complex astrophysical phenomena, thereby serving as a cost-effective supplement to existing supercomputing facilities.<br/><br/>Building on the new BlackHoles@Home (BH@H) numerical relativity (NR) code, this award advances the accessibility and utility of NR simulations on consumer-grade hardware. By implementing a highly efficient, dynamic multi-patch numerical grid, the project significantly reduces the memory and computational demands traditionally associated with binary black hole (BBH) simulations. This enables the execution of high-fidelity simulations within the resource constraints of consumer-grade computing hardware, opening up opportunities for widespread participation in this exciting gravitational wave science. The award also supports the development of enhanced NR tools and techniques, including a solver capable of generating extreme-BBH and beyond-general relativity initial data.

"Wildfire is a fundamental process in many forest ecosystems, but intensifying wildfire regimes are threatening the carbon storage capacity and ecosystem services they provide. While many tree and microbial species have evolved traits that make them resilient to and often benefit from fire, many forests are failing to recover, and we don’t know why. Within biology, incremental advances within siloed disciplines have provided very few science-informed solutions to mitigate climate change, the primary driver behind extreme wildfire and drought events. EMBER posits this problem exists because molecular and cellular processes have never been embedded in ecosystem research. EMBER’s vision is to identify key traits and variables that govern how biological communities respond to and interact with stress. By uniting a team of diverse scientists with expertise spanning multiple biological disciplines, EMBER aims to transform our understanding of fundamental controls on forest processes. To extend its vision and reach, EMBER will partner with the Coeur d’Alene tribe and the Bonneville Environmental Foundation to establish an Indigenous Innovation Lab for tribal and rural students, develop a unique teacher fellows training program, and engage with citizens from across the political spectrum (including climate change skeptics). Expected outcomes of these efforts include determining thresholds for forest recovery, predicting how stress impacts the forest carbon sink, training the next generation of scientists to transcend disciplines for use-inspired solutions to climate change, and developing an effective science-communication framework to inform forest policy. <br/><br/>By Embedding Molecular Biology in Ecosystem Research, the EMBER Institute will identify key traits and variables that govern how biological communities respond to and interact with compounding environmental stress. EMBER focuses on two overarching Aims: (1) Identify direct physiological and evolutionary acclimation strategies of individual model microorganisms and conifer tree species to simulated fire and drought and (2) Determine how these stress-response strategies influence ecological interactions among organisms (microbe-microbe and microbe-tree) that scale-up to impact ecosystem resilience and function. Beginning with controlled laboratory experiments and tractable model organisms, EMBER will determine how stress induces transcriptional and functional responses that impact microbial community assembly and conifer seedling physiology. Fire and drought conditions will be manipulated at an experimental field site to test how biological responses scale up to impact the forest carbon balance. Finally, ecosystem modeling will be used to test whether transcriptional and compositional signatures modulate key forest processes (e.g., photosynthesis, metabolism, mortality risk). Because evolution and plasticity are just beginning to be incorporated into ecosystem models, EMBER will capitalize on a tremendous and exciting opportunity to use experimental data to directly inform model development. Ultimately, these activities will help scientists unravel linkages within and among levels of organization to reveal the underlying traits that predict biological responses to increasing and compounding environmental stress.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,15000000.00,2669046,4900,Cross-BIO Activities,2320667,,Tara Hudiburg,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,thudiburg@uidaho.edu,Tara,Hudiburg,rsbeaman@nsf.gov,Reed Beaman,7032927163,['01002425DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],05/06/2024,05/01/2024,04/30/2030,BII: EMBER: Embedding Molecular Biology in Ecosystem Research in an era of increasing wildfire and drought,Cooperative Agreement,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Christopher J Marx', 'Norma C Martinez-Gomez', 'Winslow D Hansen', 'Laurel Lynch']",,,

This project accelerates research and education at the University of Idaho while improving access to shared cyberinfrastructure for our peer research universities, primarily undergraduate institutions, and tribal research partners.<br/><br/>This project achieves two primary objectives: 1) replacing legacy multi-mode fiber optics to enable 10Gbps high-speed access to the Deep Soil Ecotron, a new NSF mid-scale infrastructure project, and 2) end-to-end modernization of 100Gbps campus Science DMZ networks through targeted equipment improvements to remove barriers to efficient scientific data exchange.<br/><br/>The Deep Soil Ecotron represents unique research infrastructure hosted at the University of Idaho, allowing U.S. investigators to conduct soil biochemistry experiments at extreme soil depths. This network improvement project replaces aging multi-mode fiber infrastructure to enable efficient data exchange with the Ecotron facility, multiplying the reach and impact of this unique national research resource. Under University of Idaho leadership, Idaho’s research universities co-manage and co-utilize significant shared cyberinfrastructure such as the Falcon supercomputer. This project provides an order-of-magnitude upgrade in data throughput to existing Science DMZ networks supporting Falcon. As multi-institutional dependency on Falcon increases, these improvements are a necessary step to support a growing set of known and future University of Idaho science drivers and collaborations within the state.<br/><br/>This award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,"47.070, 47.083",QWYKRJH5NNJ3,628415.00,628415,4900,Campus Cyberinfrastructure,2346652,,Daniel R Ewart,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,dewart@uidaho.edu,Daniel,Ewart,kthompso@nsf.gov,Kevin Thompson,7032924220,['01002425DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],03/18/2024,04/01/2024,03/31/2026,Research Infrastructure: CC*Networking Infrastructure: Deep Soil to Supercomputing - Infrastructure Enhancements as a Force Multiplier for Idaho Research,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Lucas J Sheneman'],R,,

"This Regional Innovation Engines Development Award seeks to leverage the Columbia River Basin (CRB)region to develop sustainable, innovative, climate-smart products and practices, and a skilled workforce to fuel a resilient, equitable, economy to combat climate change. The project, named FIERCE, will lay the groundwork for this climate-smart ecosystem in the CRB states of Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. Through a two-tiered system, FIERCE will develop the scaffolding for the following underlying program focus areas: Use-inspired Research and Development, Translation of Innovations to Practice, Workforce Development, Ecosystem Partnerships, and Indigenous Innovations. Use-inspired research projects within FIERCE will be used to develop solutions and tools for measuring and verifying their effectiveness to ensure they reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases. FIERCE will engage with all citizens to strengthen existing and create new distributed workforce development programs, especially in Indigenous communities who, as holders of large tracts of sovereign lands in the West, are essential partners to a climate-smart future beginning in the region. Finally, FIERCE will translate innovations to practice through strategic partnerships with regional economic development organizations, entrepreneurs, state agencies, and climate-smart incubators.<br/><br/>Increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases from a fossil-fuel-based economy have caused a dangerous increase in global temperatures causing megafires and megadroughts that have impacted community infrastructure, food and fiber availability, water quality and quantity, and human health. Climate-smart solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sequester carbon, and increase regional climate adaptation while maintaining or increasing economic output are required to solve these destructive problems. The FIERCE engine will research, develop, identify, and translate climate-smart solutions and products through a unique ecosystem of agricultural, forestry, energy, educational, and business development partners in the region. In the development phase, FIERCE will strengthen existing partnerships and build new relationships with direct funding sources that can infuse capital and invest long-term in the FIERCE Engine. Working groups for each of the FIERCE focal areas will convene to identify, synthesize, and prioritize regional projects and ideas for FIERCE to support in the growth phase. Outcomes of this work will generate publications and reports that will be used to guide further Engine development, strengthened partnerships committed to the climate change and societal goals underlying the FIERCE vision, and the foundation for a resilient ecosystem that fosters creativity, inclusion, and economically-viable solutions to climate change.

"The goal of the project is to understand the current conditions, challenges, and resources that pertain to mathematics education in rural areas in the United States. The project team will conduct a national survey of rural middle school mathematics educators and administrators with follow-up interviews to understand the current trends in instructional practices and curriculum materials, the resources in rural communities that support mathematics education, and the challenges faced by rural mathematics educators. Following the survey and interviews 10 rural middle schools will be recruited to participate in a professional development (PD) model aimed at supporting rigorous forms of mathematics curriculum and instruction will be implemented. The project team will study the ways in which rural mathematics educators respond to the implementation of the PD model to understand the resources or constraints that facilitate or impede the uptake of rigorous mathematics instruction. The project team will then engage in dialogue with a range of partners in rural mathematics education contexts, including state and regional education policy makers, to generate a set of recommendations for enhancing the rigor of mathematics instruction in rural areas. The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>This is a four-phase research study with the goal of understanding the current conditions, challenges, and resources that pertain to middle school mathematics education in rural areas in the United States. The first phase will be a national survey of a representative sample of teachers, teacher leaders, and administrators who are responsible for mathematics education in rural areas. A sub-sample of the survey respondents will be recruited for follow-up interviews to develop deeper understandings of the insights that emerge from the surveys. Ten rural middle schools will be recruited to participate in professional development. Schools will be selected in part based on an expressed interest in enhancing their efforts to implement rigorous mathematics curriculum and instruction, which is defined in this project along three dimensions: eliciting and responding to student thinking; positioning students as sources of mathematical authority; and using complex, authentic, high-demand tasks. These dimensions are supported by empirical literature from the U.S. and from countries with strong records of mathematical achievement. This three-part synchronous online professional development model was developed from a prior research project and has already been effectively implemented in rural settings. The purpose of implementing the professional development model will be to better understand how the resources and constraints in rural settings impact the uptake of efforts to implement rigorous mathematics curriculum and instruction. The final phase of the project will convene groups of state and regional partners, including personnel from state departments of education and other groups of educators who support rural education, to engage in dialogue and ultimately produce a set of recommendations designed to enhance rural mathematics education. A mixed methods approach to data analysis will be employed. Survey data will be quantitatively analyzed and results will be nationally representative of rural areas.

"In the growing global public health threat of antibiotic resistance, bacteria escape the effect of drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics in humans and livestock farming is fueling the rise of multidrug resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Advances in biotechnology have uncovered a new paradigm for antimicrobial therapy known as “collateral sensitivity”, which refers to a trade-of such that the resistance mechanisms acquired by bacteria for one antibiotic that can make them more vulnerable to another. However, scheduling the order and time of antibiotic treatment to exploit collateral sensitivity is challenging and largely unexplored. With this LEAPS-MPS project, the research team will create the mathematical foundations to model the population dynamics of antibiotic-resistant and -susceptible bacteria. Computational algorithms will predict the best chronological order and respective duration of each antibiotic. The developed approaches will potentially guide more effective drug regimens that limit resistance development and prolong available therapies' effectiveness. This project also supports the training of undergraduate and graduate students in applied mathematics research. The PI will reach out to historically underrepresented minority students and recruit them to work on STEM activities. To increase accessibility, educational and research materials will be disseminated through publications, conference presentations, workshops, and free online videos.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of this project revolve around developing a mathematical framework for predicting bacterial populations' evolution based on the concept of collateral sensitivity. Bacterial population dynamics of antibiotic resistance can be described using nonlinear switched systems. Control invariant sets for this class of models will be investigated to ensure desired properties such as stability, safety, and performance. Computational algorithms will be created for approximating control invariant sets and permanence sets within a region outside the origin of the associated nonlinear switched systems. By identifying control invariant sets, it will become possible to design control strategies that maintain a system within these sets, conducting predictable and desirable system behavior. Model predictive control will solve an online finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem subject to system dynamics and constraints involving states and control. This set of mathematical tools will help practitioners decide on cycling therapies that can reduce antibiotic resistance and consequently eradicate the bacterial infection in the host. This interdisciplinary project provides opportunities for training students in different areas of computational mathematics, engineering, and biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.049,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,250000.00,250000,4900,LEAPS-MPS,2315862,,Esteban A Hernandez Vargas,875 PERIMETER DR MS 1103,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,esteban@uidaho.edu,Esteban,Hernandez Vargas,ygorb@nsf.gov,Yuliya Gorb,7032922113,['01002324DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/18/2023,11/01/2023,10/31/2025,LEAPS-MPS: Controllable sets for nonlinear switched models with applications to infectious diseases,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,A,,
"Adaptation consists of a set of behaviors and activities that occur from individual to institutional scales. Such adaptation results in the ability to remain healthy, effective and prosperous, despite changes that occur in the biophysical environment. Adaptation is also predicated on accurate perception of change, a set of abilities embedded in human cognition. Perception has been extensively studied in the context of risk and acute climate events such as flooding and wildfire, but data show that perceiving risk does not lead to successful adaptation which is critical for everything from human health to national security. Current approaches of hazard, vulnerability and risk mapping are ineffective; they do not accelerate adaptation and data show that they may even drive maladaptive behaviors. Rural communities constitute nearly 84% of the United States (US) land area and are home to 14% of the population. These areas serve as critical sources of food, freshwater, habitat, and energy as well as supporting carbon sequestration, education, recreation, and tourism but have been effectively left out of climate dialogues. Moreover, they are models for settlements in other parts of the world. Despite the rapid progress of technologies that can facilitate adaptation to climate change, widespread actions remain elusive. The need to understand the gap between knowing and experiencing the effects of a rapidly changing earth system and the behaviors that successfully respond to them has never been greater. When perception varies significantly from real world dynamics, it refers to a large gap (or difference), which may be associated with maladaptive behavior. The project hypothesize that the size of this gap is a key measure that determines both adaptive capacity, i.e., the potential to take actions that minimize the negative effects of climate change and adaptation. This project's research team will use participatory socio-environmental systems mapping, engaging the residents of rural communities as well as advanced computational modeling to project futures under different scenarios of change and responses to it.  This project will lead to precise understanding of the mechanisms between perceptions, cultures and adaptation which will enable both better planning by increasing the diversity of knowledge as well as lead to more successful implementation in areas and regions that are central to our Nation’s sustainability, security and thrivability. <br/><br/>The RII Track-2:  Where We Live (W2L) Local and Place Based Adaptation to Climate Change in Underserved Rural Communities project builds national research competitiveness and capacity to addressing the critical national need of proactively addressing climate change in underserved rural communities. The W2L project advances research, education, workforce development, and partnerships among the Idaho, Nevada, and South Carolina EPSCoR jurisdictions. W2L leverages and enhances linkages in community engagement, computational modeling, engineering,  physical sciences, and social sciences. The goal of W2L is to build the needed capacity to achieve adaptation mapping—the ability to leverage agent-based models to determine how small adaptation actions produce community-scale resilience, a novel contribution to tackling the climate challenge. The scope of the project involves communities and landscapes experiencing drought, heat, and wildfires in Idaho, Nevada, and South Carolina, areas of growing local and national concern. The project advances novel science and training by working collaboratively with underserved rural communities to advance understanding of how perceptions, values, and knowledge promote or impede adaptation to chronic (slow) and acute (fast) climate-induced changes. The project uses integrative approaches that bring together climate science, social science, computational modeling, and stakeholder engagement. Methods include development of community data oversight groups in each jurisdiction; and use of a structured workshop called the quadrant-enabled Delphi method to support co-development of knowledge by community members and researchers. Quantification of the delta between perceptions of change and instrumented measures of climate change will use data mining of historical climate data and categorical data analysis from the structured workshops. The identification of adaptation pathways with communities will involve a set of iteratively developed scenarios for each type of climate-induced change supported by climate projections that are looked at by communities though a dialogues of change activity. Dialogues of change are used to support adaptation mapping for drought, heat, and wildfire. The W2L project emphasizes community engagement and the co-production of knowledge and implements multiple initiatives to increase the participation of members of underserved rural communities in research and in STEM. W2L will support workforce development, early-career advancement, and student training through high-context, community-engaged interdisciplinary science, co-created with community members. The potential contributions of W2L are to build convergence-science through collaborative approaches with community groups; to quantify and analyze the convergence and/or divergence between perceptions of climate-induced changes and instrument measured changes in those changes; and to build pathways for adaptive capacity and adaptation options in rural underserved communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.083,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,2435509.00,1214122,4900,EPSCoR RII Track-2 FEC,2316126,,Lilian Alessa,875 PERIMETER DR MS 2481,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,alessa@uidaho.edu,Lilian,Alessa,jcolom@nsf.gov,Jose Colom,7032927088,['01AB2324DB R&RA DRSA DEFC AAB'],08/04/2023,10/01/2023,09/30/2027,Collaborative Research: RII Track-2 FEC: Where We Live: Local and Place Based Adaptation to Climate Change in Underserved Rural Communities,Cooperative Agreement,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Alistair M Smith', 'Erich Seamon']",,"['Forest Science~2024~70~Sparks, Aaron M and Corrao, Mark V and Keefe, Robert F and Armstrong, Ryan and Smith, Alistair_M S~https://doi.org/10.1093/forsci/fxae015~~~~~An Accuracy Assessment of Field and Airborne Laser Scanning–Derived Individual Tree Inventories using Felled Tree Measurements and Log Scaling Data in a Mixed Conifer Forest~~~10517071~10517071~OSTI~2024-06-25 01:59:56.820~', 'Forest Science~2024~~Sparks, Aaron M and Blanco, Alexander S and Lad, Lauren E and Smith, Alistair M and Adams, Henry D and Tinkham, Wade T~https://doi.org/10.1093/forsci/fxae013~~~~~Prefire Drought Intensity Drives Postfire Recovery and Mortality in &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Pinus monticola&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Pseudotsuga menziesii&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; Saplings~~~10503920~10503920~OSTI~2024-06-25 02:01:33.620~']",
"Infectious diseases that normally thrive in wild animals occasionally make the leap into the human population. For instance, rabies virus infects and kills tens of thousands of people each year when wild animals carrying the virus bite humans and transmit the virus to them. Other viruses that occasionally leap from animals to humans are even more dangerous because they can also transmit from human to human and thus potentially seed epidemics or pandemics. Unfortunately, we do not yet have effective solutions in place to stop these infectious diseases from spilling over into the human population. Instead, our current approach to these animal diseases is reactive, and focuses on medical treatment of humans who have become infected and corralling human outbreaks before they can spread and become full blown epidemics or pandemics. A promising solution to this challenging problem is the development of wildlife vaccines that can spread themselves from one animal to the next. By self-disseminating, these vaccines magnify the spread of immunity within the wild animal population and reduce or eliminate the risk of spillover into the human population. Although multiple self-disseminating animal vaccines are being developed, we do not yet have the mathematical, statistical, and computational tools we need to critically evaluate their performance and thus make informed decisions about their possible use. Work on this project will develop these quantitative tools and enable candidate self-disseminating vaccines to be critically evaluated before they are used. In addition, this project will train first-generation college students from rural backgrounds to use mathematical and computational models to evaluate and optimize emerging biotechnologies critical to the future of the US economy. Student recruitment will be facilitated by offering competitive financial support that relieves pressure to abandon research experiences in favor of traditional employment. Finally, this project will continue development of a website that explains self-disseminating vaccines to the public, disseminates relevant research results, and examines the state of this emerging technology.<br/><br/>Before making the decision to conduct even small-scale field trials, the likelihood that a self-disseminating vaccine will improve human health should be quantified. This requirement poses a formidable technical challenge because data on the behavior of the vaccine within the target animal population cannot be collected prior to release. This project will overcome this technical challenge using mathematical models of recombinant vector transmissible vaccines that can be parameterized using a combination of field and laboratory data. Specifically, mathematical models will be developed that integrate the age structure of the reservoir population and the explicit pattern of vaccine shedding from animals infected with vaccine. These models will take the form of a system of partial differential equations. Field data will come from trapping studies of the reservoir animal that record the age of each captured animal and whether it was infected by the vector virus used to construct the candidate vaccine. Laboratory data will describe the temporal pattern of vaccine shedding from reservoir animals experimentally infected with the vaccine. Approximate Bayesian computation will be used to parameterize the models and a stochastic simulation framework developed for predicting the outcome of a proposed vaccine release. By repeatedly simulating a vaccine release for models parameterized by drawing randomly from the posterior distribution, this framework faithfully integrates reservoir ecology, randomness in biological processes, and uncertainty in parameter estimates. The methodology developed by this project will be applied to a prototype self-disseminating vaccine for Lassa virus but will be broadly applicable to self-disseminating vaccines developing for a range of animal reservoirs.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Population and Community Ecology (PCE) Cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Mathematical Biology Program in the Division of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,"47.049, 47.074, 47.083",QWYKRJH5NNJ3,664468.00,664468,4900,Population & Community Ecology,2314616,,Scott L Nuismer,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,snuismer@uidaho.edu,Scott,Nuismer,mvonholl@nsf.gov,Betsy Von Holle,7032924974,['01002324DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/21/2023,10/01/2023,09/30/2026,Predicting the spread and impact of transmissible vaccines,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,L,"['Expert Review of Vaccines~2024~23~Bull, James J and Nuismer, Scott L and Remien, Christopher H and Griffiths, Megan E and Antia, Rustom~https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2024.2320845~~~~~Recombinant transmissible vaccines will be intrinsically contained despite the ability to superinfect~N~~10533386~10533386~OSTI~2024-08-15 15:33:03.113~', 'Science~2024~384~Streicker, Daniel G and Griffiths, Megan E and Antia, Rustom and Bergner, Laura and Bowman, Peter and de_Moraes, Maria_Vitoria_dos Santos and Esvelt, Kevin and Famulare, Mike and Gilbert, Amy and He, Biao and Jarvis, Michael A and Kennedy, David A and Kuz~https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adn3231~~~~~Developing transmissible vaccines for animal infections~N~~10533346~10533346~OSTI~2024-08-15 14:10:32.370~']",
"This conference proposes to host a two-day conference at the Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES) in Idaho Falls, Idaho. This conference will feature keynotes, panels, and breakout sessions with an estimated sixty participants covering various aspects of intelligent manufacturing for extreme environments. The conference will convene world-class experts, researchers, educators, and students to identify gaps and envision solutions in relevant areas of great importance. The conference will promote exchange of ideas and knowledge during the proposed event and will catalyze new collaborations and research directions that will support the growth of carbon-free advanced nuclear energy research in Idaho, Wyoming, as well as other western states. The conference organizers will use funding for travel grants, recruiting women and persons from underrepresented groups to participate to achieve participation from a diverse section of the society. The outcomes of the conference will include an opportunity for researchers and educators to network and form collaborations and preparation of a full report to inform policy makers, industry, and the academic community of various challenges and opportunities of advanced manufacturing, specifically in the nuclear energy sector.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this conference proposal is to host a two-day conference on Intelligent Manufacturing for Extreme Environments. The conference will identify gaps and envision solutions for five inter-related challenges of intelligent manufacturing in extreme environments. These challenges are: (1) printable electronics that can survive extreme environments, (2) in situ manufacturing process monitoring and feedback control, (3) machine learning to optimize process variables in manufacturing and materials composition, (4) extreme temperature qualification and testing, and (5) workforce development and community college engagement. Nuclear reactors need to operate under extreme service conditions such as high temperatures, corrosive environment, and high radiation doses. Hence, reactor components must be able to withstand those conditions. Successful innovation would revolutionize the nuclear power sector, enable fast commercial development, create economic opportunities in the US, reduce carbon footprint and associated climate risks, and promote a skilled and highly competitive workforce. The novelty of the conference is the convergent integration of computational design, process control, materials discovery, materials characterization, and workforce development. The conference will provide an opportunity for the community to discuss new scientific research, the needs for future research, gaps in the scientific literature, and provide a conference of national interest that could drive scientific engagement with the broader community including involving researchers from the underrepresented groups, and industry collaborations. The conference will provide opportunities to engage with industry, provide opportunities for community college educators to learn about what is happening at the cutting-edge of manufacturing science, and increase public awareness through science engagement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.083,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,99445.00,99445,4900,EPSCoR Outreach and Workshops,2328585,,Indrajit Charit,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,icharit@uidaho.edu,Indrajit,Charit,pbentzvi@nsf.gov,Pinhas Ben-Tzvi,7032928246,['01002324DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],08/17/2023,09/01/2023,08/31/2024,Conference: NSF EPSCoR Workshop: Intelligent Manufacturing for Extreme Environments,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Patrick A Johnson', 'Marco P Schoen', 'John Russell', 'David Estrada']",,,
"There is a national need to proactively address the impacts of climate, population, and technological change on energy and water (E-W) systems across key watersheds in the western U.S. This ""Idaho Community-engaged Resilience for Energy-Water Systems"" (I-CREWS) project will use Idaho’s Snake River Basin watershed to address two questions:  1) What role do trade-offs and changes in E-W systems, including storage, efficiency, conservation, local knowledge, and governance dynamics, play in determining resilience strategies for climate-driven, population, and technological change? and (2) How does incorporating diverse ways of knowing, community engagement, and advanced modeling lead to more equitable and resilient E-W futures? The State of Idaho provides an excellent testbed for the project. This is due to the features of Idaho’s landscapes, which span a range of gradients (e.g., hydrologic, topographic, demographic, jurisdictional) and population densities (e.g., small rural towns and Native American communities to expanding urban areas). The results of the I-CREWS project will inform multisystemic resilience and E-W issues nationally. I-CREWS will be administered by the University of Idaho in collaboration with Boise State University, Idaho State University, the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, and the Coeur d'Alene Tribe.  The I-CREWS project will grow research capacity with partner Tribal nations through a new Tribal Nations Research Network (TNRN), which will be developed to recenter knowledge exchange between Tribes and Idaho universities, focusing on collaboration through the development of tribally-originated research.  <br/><br/>The key research themes of I-CREWS are to: (1) characterize and evaluate E-W configurations for a continuum of resilience strategies; (2) model and represent E-W configurations and their resilience; and (3) develop alternative futures scenarios of E-W trajectories and their resilience to change. I-CREWS researchers will use socio-environmental-technological systems (SETS) typologies in their hypothesis that communities undergoing changes in their E-W systems can be characterized by SETS typologies at different scales to determine patterns of multisystemic resilience to climate-driven, demographic, and technological changes. I-CREWS researchers aim to determine whether the adoption of SETS interventions increases resilience and reduces vulnerability in E-W systems. The research will investigate the interaction of competing objectives (e.g., energy, water, resources, public use, local values) in a community-decision context. The I-CREWS project will engage partners across constituencies (scientists, land managers, policymakers, administrators, Tribal nations, and end users) in order to advance the integration of more comprehensive science with management and policy strategies for resilient stewardship and governance, thus providing locally-valued choices as well as capacity-building to achieve the project’s impacts.  I-CREWS will support workforce development and student training through high-context, community-engaged courses and projects that are co-created with community members to address E-W systems issues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.083,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,20000000.00,7378643,4900,EPSCoR RII Track-1,2242769,,Andrew D Kliskey,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,akliskey@uidaho.edu,Andrew,Kliskey,jsmall@nsf.gov,Jeanne Small,7032928623,"['01AB2324DB R&RA DRSA DEFC AAB', '01002425DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",05/05/2023,08/01/2023,07/31/2028,RII Track-1: Idaho Community-engaged Resilience for Energy-Water Systems (I-CREWS),Cooperative Agreement,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Kitty E Griswold', 'Karla Eitel', 'Kathleen Araujo', 'Alistair M Smith']",D,"['Remote Sensing~2023~15~Lad, Lauren E. and Tinkham, Wade T. and Sparks, Aaron M. and Smith, Alistair M.~https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15245703~~~~~Evaluating Predictive Models of Tree Foliar Moisture Content for Application to Multispectral UAS Data: A Laboratory Study~~~10503925~10503925~OSTI~2024-05-01 19:06:28.520~', 'Forest Ecology and Management~2023~545~Sparks, Aaron M. and Smith, Alistair M.S. and Hudak, Andrew T. and Corrao, Mark V. and Kremens, Robert L. and Keefe, Robert F.~https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121246~~~~~Integrating active fire behavior observations and multitemporal airborne laser scanning data to quantify fire impacts on tree growth: A pilot study in mature Pinus ponderosa stands~~~10503921~10503921~OSTI~2024-05-01 18:58:17.880~', 'Forest Science~2024~~Sparks, Aaron M and Blanco, Alexander S and Lad, Lauren E and Smith, Alistair M and Adams, Henry D and Tinkham, Wade T~https://doi.org/10.1093/forsci/fxae013~~~~~Prefire Drought Intensity Drives Postfire Recovery and Mortality in &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Pinus monticola&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Pseudotsuga menziesii&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; Saplings~~~10503920~10503920~OSTI~2024-06-25 02:01:33.620~', 'International Journal of Wildland Fire~2024~33~Fillmore, Stephen D. and McCaffrey, Sarah and Bean, Rachel and Evans, Alexander M. and Iniguez, Jose and Thode, Andrea and Smith, Alistair M. and Thompson, Matthew P.~https://doi.org/10.1071/WF23129~~~~~Factors influencing wildfire management decisions after the 2009 US federal policy update~~~10503923~10503923~OSTI~2024-05-01 19:02:09.983~']",
"Earth’s cooling rate affects many processes necessary for a dynamic, living world, from plate tectonics to generation of the planet’s magnetic field. Understanding the establishment, evolution, and continued functioning of such processes requires knowledge of the planet’s thermal history, but much of that history remains unconstrained in part because several controlling mechanisms have yet to be quantified. As such, this award aims to study how Earth’s cooling rate may be altered through variable insulation of the planet’s interior by continents along the surface and large, continent-sized piles of anomalous material (Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces; LLSVPs) covering portions of the outer core. Previous studies separately examined the insulating effects of continents and LLSVPs, but none focused on the potentially counteracting effects of simultaneous insulating bodies: continents are predicted to increase the mantle’s internal temperature while LLSVPs decrease it. This study will quantify the resulting dynamic and thermal effects of such bodies and the implications for the Earth’s cooling history, plate tectonics, and magnetic field. Furthermore, both continents and LLSVPs act as chemical reservoirs that isolate critical elements from participating in global cycling for potentially long portions of Earth’s history. However, the formation and evolution of LLSVPs is still actively debated. This study will identify their likely thermal and chemical fingerprints as an additional means of testing their potential formation timing and duration. In addition to scientific advances, this project will expand educational opportunities centered on the deep Earth through an interdisciplinary game development program that will produce a new, widely distributed, educationally focused video game designed to combat several geoscience misconceptions while supporting a diverse, interdisciplinary group of ten undergraduate student developers. Finally, this award supports two graduate students and a post-doctoral scholar at two rural, land-grant universities, Washington State University and University of Idaho. <br/><br/>This award supports a novel study that will systematically evaluate how simultaneous surface and basal insulating bodies in Earth’s mantle (continents + LLSVPs) jointly alter the thermal evolution and internal mantle dynamics of the Earth. Two-dimensional spherical numerical simulations will be used to quantify the impacts of simulated LLSVP and continental materials in models of increasing rheological, thermal, and temporal complexity to address three research objectives: (1) isolate the fundamental processes governing interactions of surface (continent) and basal (LLSVP) insulators, (2) quantify the influence of complex rheology and internal heating on the basal and surface insulator convective system, and (3) examine impacts of time-evolving basal and surface insulators through Earth’s history. Numerical simulations of the Earth’s mantle subject to surface (continent) and basal (LLSVP) insulators will be conducted using the highly parallel finite-element code ASPECT (Advanced Solver for Problems in Earth’s ConvecTion). Simulations will be solved in parallel across ~32-256 computational cores on University of Idaho’s Falcon supercomputer (>33k cores, 1.17 Petaflop) or Washington State University’s Kamiak high performance computer cluster. For each of the ~200 planned simulations, the conservation equations will be discretized across a dynamically refined grid of ~2 million finite elements with enhanced element resolution near strong thermal and compositional gradients, allowing an accurate quantification of heat transfer through the model system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,509641.00,358318,4900,Geophysics,2310324,,Eric L Mittelstaedt,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,emittelstaedt@uidaho.edu,Eric,Mittelstaedt,wpanero@nsf.gov,Wendy Panero,7032925058,"['01002324DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002425DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",06/08/2023,07/01/2023,06/30/2026,Collaborative Research: As above so below: Quantifying the role of simultaneous LLSVPs and continents on Earth's cooling history using numerical simulations of mantle convection,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,L,,
"This project aims to perform a millennial-length, multi-metric synthesis of sub-annual paleoclimate and extreme events in the Greater Yellowstone Ecoregion (GYE) through the use of tree-ring methodologies. <br/><br/>The researchers will: (1) generate millennial-length chronologies of quantitative wood anatomy (QWA) metrics from two co-occurring subalpine/treeline tree species; (2) produce regional, millennial-length reconstructions of sub-annual temperature variability; and (3) analyze connections between climate variability and external forcings. The creation of a millennial-length climate history derived from QWA metrics may provide new insights into important high-elevation ecosystems of the western United States (U.S.) and further contextualize climate change for the GYE. Analysis between reconstructed sub-annual temperature data with currently available reconstruction and model data will aid  understanding of complex climate interrelationships for the GYE and the western U.S. more broadly and inform assessments of current and future conditions.<br/><br/>Information generated by this research will aid local, national, and international climatologists, conservation biologists, and land managers to better predict future climate change impacts for the GYE and western U.S. more broadly and provide data to the Whitebark Pine Ecosystem Foundation (WPEF), U.S. Forest Service, and other governmental and non-governmental agencies that have interest in whitebark-specific responses to climate change and ecological disturbance. <br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) include support for the careers of several early-career female scientists as well as resources toward undergraduate education, K-12 activities, and community engagement.

"The goal of the Biology of Vector-borne Diseases (BVBD) course is to train graduate students and faculty, health practitioners, government workers, and policymakers to view the biological interactions and parallels among plant, animal, and human health in complex ecosystems as a basis for novel interventions to diseases that currently burden hundreds of millions of people across the globe. Vector-borne diseases are caused by pathogens transmitted by one organism, often an insect, to another organism with disease resulting from pathogen infection. The majority of these diseases have few to no effective interventions for control. Through short presentations, case studies, hands-on modeling exercises, and group discussions of “wicked challenges”, participants learn about the biological connections across plant, animal, and human vector-borne diseases from the subcellular to the ecosystem scale. The annual BVBD course is taught by internationally recognized experts to diverse participants from across the US and around the world, connecting individuals from all impacted regions. The BVBD course is unique in its content and approach to inspire diverse stakeholders and actors to concurrently and holistically address plant, animal, and human vector-borne diseases as interconnected health challenges. <br/><br/>Plant, animal, and human vector-borne diseases drive food insecurity across continents, devastate livestock production and cause the deaths of millions each year. These pathosystems are intricately connected in complex ecosystems that range from areas of dense urbanization, agricultural production from the pastoralist to industrial scales, managed forests and deforestation, and large regions that are increasingly subjected to extreme wildfire, drought, temperature shifts and catastrophic weather events. Within these environments, the shared biology and common drivers of plant, animal, and human vector-borne diseases enable not only pathosystem persistence, but also migration and invasion of new species of plants and animals that can fuel disease emergence and re-emergence. There is growing recognition that these connections across multiple biological scales can and should be leveraged concurrently to increase efficiency, sustainability, and efficacy of new control programs to improve health outcomes across all organisms. However, we face substantial intellectual and logistical obstacles in effecting these changes. The BVBD course delivers an integrated framework to break down intellectual and communication barriers that impede our ability to address these disease challenges in complex ecosystems. Because vector-borne diseases disproportionately burden the most under-served and under-resourced populations and regions, it is critical that BVBD participants and instructors reflect both the diversity of populations impacted by these diseases and a range of expertise and experience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,250000.00,100000,4900,Ecology of Infectious Diseases,2316443,,Shirley Luckhart,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,sluckhart@uidaho.edu,Shirley,Luckhart,aporrasa@nsf.gov,Andrea Porras-Alfaro,7032922944,"['01002324DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002425DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",05/02/2023,05/01/2023,04/30/2028,Conference: University of Idaho Institute for Health in the Human Ecosystem Biology of Vector-borne Diseases Course,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Edwin E Lewis'],,,

The 20th International Conference on Permutation Patterns will be held in June 2024, at the University of Idaho in Moscow, ID.  These are part of a series of annual conferences on permutation patterns that have been held annually since 2003 (with virtual substitutes during the Covid pandemic), rotating mostly between many different institutions in North America and Europe. Each year the conference features two plenary talks and around thirty-five contributed talks, both giving researchers the opportunity to present and discuss their results and giving newcomers to the study of permutation patterns a broad perspective on the subject as a whole.  The conference provides an opportunity for collaboration between junior and senior researchers as well as between researchers from all parts of the world, and there will be time set aside for open problems to be discussed by the entire community.  The conference attracts broad participation, including significant numbers of women and of faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions.  This award supports travel to the conferences by student and early career participants from the United States.<br/><br/>The conferences will feature research on permutation patterns and their applications.  Permutation patterns is an interdisciplinary area with roots in both theoretical computer science and combinatorics.  Major themes include the structural properties of permutation classes, asymptotic behavior from both enumerative and probabilistic points of view, extremal questions, algorithmic and decidability questions, and automated theorem proving and discovery.  There are applications to other areas of mathematics and computer science as well as to biology.

"The construction sector is a major contributor to the U.S. economy. It represents over 4% of the U.S. GDP, equivalent to 1.36 trillion dollars. Despite recent advancements, studies indicate that the construction industry is still one of the least computerized sectors compared to manufacturing, telecommunication, and retail industries. In line with this, the construction research community faces significant challenges when it comes to adopting new data science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions and techniques. Several factors, such as complexity and uniqueness of construction projects, the rapid pace of evolution of such technologies, and unfamiliarity of traditional construction faculty with such topics, cause this situation. As a result, it is crucial for researchers and academic experts to develop novel educational and training strategies to bridge such research skills gaps and strengthen construction research data literacy and digital fluency. This project addresses the above challenges faced by educators and researchers in construction engineering through the development of an educational and community engagement platform called CyCon (Cyber Construction). <br/><br/>The CyCon platform focuses on state-of-the-art AI/ML techniques and cloud computing solutions that serve CI (CyberInfrastructure) users, contributors, and professionals in the construction research community. The CyCon platform contains the following four training and educational components: (1) CI user resource modules, including modular learning coursework and course project libraries, to train CyCon users with basic and advanced CI research skills, (2) CI educator resource modules that provide novel strategies and online materials to efficiently train educators, (3) CI competition modules to help CyCon users practice and further advance their knowledge about AI/ML products and tools using real-world construction problems, and (4) CI crowdsourcing modules that provide a well-defined data pipeline using data warehouses to enrich construction datasets available for public use. The CyCon platform is designed as a sustainable educational and community engagement framework for the construction CI research community and is expected to significantly improve the learning and teaching experiences of CI users and educators at various construction programs nationwide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.070,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,359828.00,359828,4900,CyberTraining - Training-based,2229604,,Amin Mirkouei,1776 Science Center Drive,Idaho Falls,US,ID02,University of Idaho - Idaho Falls,ID,834021575,amirkouei@uidaho.edu,Amin,Mirkouei,shabagch@nsf.gov,Sharmistha Bagchi-Sen,7032928104,['01002223DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],09/06/2022,01/01/2023,12/31/2026,Collaborative Research: CyberTraining: Implementation: Medium: CyberTraining of Construction (CyCon) Research Workforce Through an Educational and Community Engagement Platform,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Xiaogang Ma'],,,
"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).<br/><br/>This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project will explore an active thermal imaging system carried by a pair of drones, one (leader) for thermal imaging and the other (follower) for active heating (e.g., microwave), to enable subsurface defect detection in the next-generation inspection of civil infrastructure in a GPS-denied environment (e.g., underneath bridge decks). Due to its limited payload and battery time, a single drone cannot support additional payload and its associated accessories required for active sensing. The concept of two leader-follower drones is thus introduced. This award supports fundamental research for the development of a drones-enabled active sensing system through synchronized drone swarming and thermal imaging. The new technique will transform the current passive surface deterioration inspection practice, which is subject to the change in sunlight conditions, into an active thermal imaging inspection for subsurface condition deterioration, such as delamination and horizontal cracks in reinforced concrete structures. In addition to infrastructure inspection and maintenance, the new technique will impact multiple frontiers with cooperative robot swarming and active sensing, such as interactive manufacturing and healthcare, and academic communities in science and engineering. The technique and research results will be transferred into the hands of engineering professionals through a national workshop.<br/><br/>The drones-enabled active sensing system will be investigated via software/hardware-in-the-loop simulations and experimental tests. This research will overcome two technical challenges: (1) to synchronize drone swarming and thermal imaging in an energy-efficient strategy and (2) to enable new thermal imaging detectability with a heat source distributed on a leader-follower drone platform to stimulate the appearance of subsurface defects in active imaging. It will lay a foundation on cooperative robot swarming and active sensing research in multiple frontiers. First, it will develop a new strategy of leader-follower formation for drone swarming with visual relative navigation and collision avoidance based on a three-dimensional stereo vision and potential field algorithm during cooperative active sensing and inspection of subsurface defects in a GPS-denied environment. Second, it will establish optimal characteristics of active sensing of microwave heated concrete decks with optimized microwave excitations (energy source, frequency and duration) and sensing protocols (measurement sensitivity, frame rate and time window). Third, it will develop a method to evaluate and improve the performance of cooperative drone swarm formation and active thermal imaging of defects in a markup solid deck concrete bridge and a potential field infrastructure inspection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,199946.00,148159,4900,ERI-Eng.

"Teachers rarely come into K-12 classrooms with an understanding of Indigenous peoples, nations, or a sense of how Indigenous peoples practice their ways of knowing in relationship to land and landscapes. This knowledge gap acutely impacts Indigenous youth who experience persistent disparities in educational opportunities, completion outcomes, and STEM representation. To address this knowledge gap, it is imperative to develop teacher professional learning that privileges tribal leadership and Indigenous knowledge in STEM education. This project connects interdisciplinary researchers and experts from four tribal nation partners to develop and implement an in-service teacher professional certificate program that integrates Indigenous Knowledge into STEM teaching. This multi-sited teacher professional development model will enroll K-12 teachers in four different Native-serving regions of the rural West into a 12-month certificate program that combines Indigenous science, Coupled Human and Natural Systems, and Land education concepts into an experiential learning cycle with local and broad study of learning with the Land. Participating teachers will gain critical knowledge to address epistemological diversity and experiential tools central to addressing complex issues of land and lifeway changes in Indigenous and rural communities. The project will add knowledge about the transferability of local epistemologies and practices and national science standards within four specific Indigenous contexts and expand space for tribal-lead professional development to transform teacher classroom practice. This award is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>The research will follow a qualitative multi-site case study approach to answer these questions: How do teachers make sense of multiple STEM epistemologies during an Indigenous, place-based, land education certificate program? What types of teacher development activities support the inclusion of Indigenous epistemologies in STEM school-based practices?  In what ways do teachers apply learning from Indigenous STEM into their curricular and pedagogical choices? Three main objectives will support the project’s central research questions: 1) Development of cross-site Partnership Teams to guide design of teacher professional development with unifying and site-specific content; 2) Implementation of site-specific immersive STEM learning opportunities for teachers and a wrap-around professional development certificate program to support pedagogical understanding; 3) Research into the impact of curriculum for teachers, i.e., on trajectories of learning and pedagogical choices in the classroom. Collected data will include pre- and post-surveys, symbol-based reflections, group interviews and talking circles with teachers, and classroom observations of teacher practice. The research will contribute to innovations in teacher education programs and professional practice and create more equitable and inclusive Land-based STEM education models for K-12.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.076,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,2999999.00,2300246,4900,Discovery Research K-12,2201148,,Vanessa Anthony-Stevens,Office of Sponsored Programs,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,vstevens@uidaho.edu,Vanessa,Anthony-Stevens,tfrank@nsf.gov,Toya frank,7032922255,"['04002223DB NSF Education & Human Resource', '04002425DB NSF STEM Education']",06/30/2022,07/01/2022,06/30/2026,Cultivating Relationships: Partnering with Teachers and Tribes to Integrate Indigenous and School STEM Knowledge,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Karla Eitel', 'Brant G Miller', 'Philip Stevens', 'Shanara Spang Gion']",,,
"A workshop will be held in Portland, Oregon to consider the issues concerning the development of a transmissible vaccine. Spillover of zoonotic pathogens has proven difficult to control and virtually impossible to eliminate. Although animal vaccination programs using standard methods have reduced the burden of spillover in some cases (e.g., rabies, brucellosis), other regions endure continued spillover because logistical and financial challenges make delivering large quantities of vaccine to wild and domestic animal populations impractical. A novel solution to this problem is the transformation of benign, naturally-occurring viruses into into vaccines capable of self dissemination, i.e., transmissible vaccines. A growing body of theory shows that vaccine transmission makes it possible to eliminate the risk of spillover from hard to reach and difficult to vaccinate animal populations at a fraction of the cost that would be required via traditional one vaccine-one host vaccination campaigns. Such vaccines are increasingly feasible to generate in the laboratory, but many technical challenges and unresolved questions underpin their safe and effective implementation in natural systems. This workshop will coordinate the development of transmissible vaccines by bringing together immunologists, vaccine engineers, virologists, disease ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and mathematical modelers. An important goal of the workshop will be to increase the diversity of the community working on this emerging technology, with a specific focus on increasing the representation of early career scientists, women, and scientists from lower middle-income countries where the technology may have the most immediate positive impacts on human health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,71669.00,71669,4900,Ecology of Infectious Diseases,2216790,,Scott L Nuismer,Office of Sponsored Programs,MOSCOW,US,ID00,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838443020,snuismer@uidaho.edu,Scott,Nuismer,sscheine@nsf.gov,Samuel Scheiner,7032927175,['01002223DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],05/03/2022,06/01/2022,05/31/2023,Conference: Coordinating the development of self-disseminating vaccines for spillover prevention,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,L,," Infectious diseases that normally circulate within animal populations can, from time to time, leap into humans. For some infectious diseases, such as rabies and Lassa virus, these jumps occur frequently and cause tens of thousands of people to die each year. This project supported a workshop that brought together experts from around the world to discuss how a novel biotechnology -- self disseminating vaccines -- can be used to attack these infectious diseases within their animal reservoirs before they can make the leap into humans. The workshop began the process of developing a framework for responsible governance and a roadmap for the safe and effective use of these novel animal vaccines. Over the three-day period the workshop was held, expert presentations and focused discussions worked to develop consensus among workshop participants. The consensus that emerged was formalized as an outline of a policy manuscript that will be completed over the next year and disseminated to the public as a published paper. In addition to establishing a framework for responsible governance, the workshop enhanced the diversity of scientists contributing to the development of this emerging biotechnology by supporting participation of early career scientists and those from regions that have not yet had the opportunity to influence the direction of this field.

"The project will develop a computational code for modeling the mergers of neutron star binaries. The new code will combine the efficiencies of a fluid dynamics code and a numerical relativity code to produce a code that can more quickly and accurately predict the expected optical afterglows from neutron star binary mergers. This will help us to learn more about the origin of heavy elements in the universe. The project will also support the development of training materials for numerical relativity at the graduate and undergraduate levels. The work will also be incorporated into the citizen-science project ""BlackHoles@Home"" that is focused on gravitational wave astronomy. Public outreach efforts will also be presented at the UW-Milwaukee planetarium. This award advances the goals of the Windows on the Universe Big Idea.<br/><br/>The project will combine the moving-mesh hydrodynamics code MANGA with an efficient numerical relativity code SENR/NRPy+. Each code relies on using an appropriate grid to model the physics. This project will integrate the two codes to allow for a moving-mesh general relativistic hydrodynamics code that will be ideal for studying compact object mergers. Upon development of the new code, the project will apply it to models of binary neutron star mergers with both polytropic and realistic equations of state. The PI at UW-Milwaukee will give general presentations on neutron stars and black holes at the planetarium and train a small number of undergraduates to organize and run planetarium shows and special events. The PI at West Virginia University will continue to support the Jupyter notebooks for SENR/NRPy+ as pedagogical training tools for students in the field of general relativistic hydrodynamics.

"Tendons act as a mechanical connection from muscle to bone. Understanding how tendons develop mechanical function is important because tendon injuries are common, treatment options are limited, and damaged tendons rarely regain their full strength. Collagen is a major contributor to tendon strength. However, much is unknown about the conditions that influence collagen formation during normal tendon development. For example, several types of enzymes crosslink and stabilize collagen in tendons, but how cells coordinate the production of these collagen crosslinking enzymes during tendon development is unknown. This project addresses this knowledge gap by exploring the signals that control enzyme production by cells. This research will generate new knowledge on how collagen crosslinking is regulated. Findings from this research will contribute to a greater understanding of the mechanisms of tendon formation and may lead to advanced therapies to treat the altered mechanical function and disability found with tendon injuries. Integral to the project are activities to improve retention in STEM and the diversity of graduates in engineering. The project creates hands-on research experiences and the writing exercises for students enrolled in a multidisciplinary engineering course. It also funds undergraduates to conduct faculty-mentored research, develop and submit NSF graduate research fellowship applications, and present their research at scientific conferences. Finally, the project includes K-12 outreach activities and laboratory tours.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of this research is to define the mechanisms that control collagen crosslinking enzyme production by cells. Adult stem cells and tendon cells isolated from developing rat tendons associated with high forces, the Achilles tendon, and low forces, the tail tendon, will be evaluated in culture as model systems to determine if these cell populations have unique control mechanisms. To test mechanically responsive pathways that regulate collagen crosslinking enzyme production, cells will be exposed to a range of mechanical stimuli using a bioreactor and treated with targeted cell signaling pathway inhibitors. The role of biological signaling in enzyme production will be evaluated using different biochemical growth factors that are known to impact tendon growth and injury, while conducting cell signaling pathway inhibition and analysis. Research outcomes will advance knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate collagen crosslinking enzyme production by tendon and stem cells.<br/><br/> This project is jointly funded by Biomechanics &amp; Mechanobiology (BMMB) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,"47.041, 47.083",QWYKRJH5NNJ3,402341.00,402341,4900,BMMB-Biomech & Mechanobiology,2145004,,Nathan R Schiele,Office of Sponsored Programs,MOSCOW,US,ID00,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838443020,nrschiele@uidaho.edu,Nathan,Schiele,shisharm@nsf.gov,Shivani Sharma,7032924204,['01002223DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],05/03/2022,05/01/2022,04/30/2025,Understanding Regulators of Collagen Crosslinking Enzymes for Tendon Formation,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,R,,
"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).<br/><br/>Fungal cells separate themselves from their environment by constructing a robust cell wall made of carbohydrates and proteins with an underlying membrane. This enables the compartmentalization of metabolic processes and protects fungal cells from external stressors, including commercial fungicides that are used extensively to control unwanted fungal growth. Antifungal proteins produced by different species of fungi can attack the cell wall and membrane causing injury and the death of susceptible fungal cells. These antifungals have been cited as potentially being useful to control the growth of undesirable fungi. This research will explore the fundamental cellular mechanisms that are employed by fungi to resist intoxication by antifungal proteins. Specifically, the project will test how mutations in genes used for cell wall and membrane construction and stability result in resistance to antifungal proteins. Antifungal proteins are produced by a significant proportion of fungi, especially by yeasts that are associated with insects, fruits, and fermentation (e.g. brewing and baking). The general familiarity of the public with yeasts will enable schoolchildren and patrons of the local farmer’s market to participate in the isolation of yeasts that produce novel antifungal proteins. These outreach activities will be enhanced by the participation of undergraduate research students to enable the identification of novel antifungal proteins and their application to further investigate the function and organization of the fungal membrane and cell wall. Students from underrepresented groups at the University of Idaho will also be included in research activities. The central goal of this approach is to increase retention of university students, enrollment in higher education of postsecondary and postbaccalaureate students, and to improve public STEM education.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to discover the cellular mechanisms that are important for fungal resistance to antifungal “killer” toxins. This will uncover novel pathways that are important for cell surface function and resilience. The research hypotheses are that the Regulator of Ace2 and Cell Morphogenesis (RAM) signaling network plays an undescribed role in cell wall and membrane organization, and that the localization and diversity of the killer toxin receptor Kre1p is essential for intoxication by killer toxins. These hypotheses were formulated based on preliminary data that has identified mutations in the RAM network that result in killer toxin resistance and the loss of membrane and cell wall integrity. To test these hypotheses, it will be determined how mutations in the RAM network that cause killer toxin resistance alter the networks organization, localization, and function relating to cytokinesis and cell polarity. Specifically, the effect of these mutations on the localization of the killer toxin membrane receptor (Kre1p) will be tested. This approach will be complemented by an in-depth study of the effect of Kre1p diversity on killer toxin resistance and the immunity mechanisms of killer yeasts that prevent self-intoxication. The outcome of this research will be to confirm the novel role of the RAM network in cell surface organization. This will be complemented by the investigation of the RAM network and Kre1p and their role in killer toxin resistance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,898220.00,527999,4900,Cellular Dynamics and Function,2143405,,Paul A Rowley,"875 Perimeter Drive, MS 3051",MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,prowley@uidaho.edu,Paul,Rowley,rcyr@nsf.gov,Richard Cyr,7032928440,"['010V2122DB R&RA ARP Act DEFC V', '01002425DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",01/24/2022,03/01/2022,02/28/2027,CAREER: Cellular Mechanisms of Killer Toxin Resistance in Yeasts,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,A,"['PLOS Pathogens~2023~19~Taggart, Nathan T. and Crabtree, Angela M. and Creagh, Jack W. and Bizarria, Rodolfo and Li, Shunji and de la Higuera, Ignacio and Barnes, Jonathan E. and Shipley, Mason A. and Boyer, Josephine M. and Stedman, Kenneth M. and Ytreberg, F.

It was instrumental in the design of the Track-1 project ? a state-federal partnership focused on community-engaged resilience for energy-water systems ? that Idaho submitted in August 2022.  The Planning Grant resulted in important dialog among project participants and stakeholders to articulate a five-year vision for the Energy-Water Security and Resilience topic. The vision for the program is Idaho-wide, bridging multiple organizations and individuals, and forward-thinking in its support for (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce development and academic research competitiveness. Engagement far beyond Idaho?s public research universities (University of Idaho as lead fiscal agent, and Idaho State University and Boise State University) included collaborations with Idaho?s Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) and multiple private and public sector partners.  Here, ?energy-water systems? refers to the intersection among the physical infrastructure, data/information/knowledge, people, laws, and policies, as well as the fuel and water that flows or is in reserve. It includes interdependent power and water systems tied to the physical infrastructure for generation, transmission, distribution, and use of power and water, along with governance and management practices, flows of information and knowledge, and the effects on end-users and consumers.  Idaho?s RII Track-1 plan centers on communities and emphasizes the importance of robust community-engaged scholarship to improve education in and resilience to environmental change. More specifically, the anticipated long-term impacts of the Track-1 project are: 1) advanced capacity in existing areas of research strengths in energy-water resilience, 2) increased capacity in emerging areas of computer modeling allied with improved state data storage and computational processing to accelerate research, 3) more equitable education, training, and solutions for complex environmental issues, and 4) expanded research competitiveness to Idaho?s Native American Tribes.  More specifically, outcomes from this Planning Grant included the documentation of key aspects of energy-water security and resilience in Idaho, including current research infrastructure that exists and additional research, capacity-building, and infrastructure (e.g., new research-active faculty positions) that are needed in Idaho to meet education, research, and workforce development goals in the future. Participants produced a set of systematic steps for achieving Idaho?s goals (also known as a logic model) that frames the shared relationships in Idaho among the resources, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impacts of a future energy-water security and resilience Track-1 project. Other outcomes were the identification and assessment of both existing and future workforce development needed to support education, training, and development of future expertise. Finally, the grant produced an agreed set of guidelines for how Idaho?s research universities, PUIs, Native American tribal governments and communities, national lab, rural communities, and private industry will work together throughout the proposed collaborative RII project.  The objectives for the Track-1 project that emerged from this Planning Grant relate to characterizing past and current energy-water system dynamics, operations, and resilience; defining plausible and practical change through computer modeling efforts; and informing trends and trajectories of future conditions affecting Idaho communities. The Planning Grant catalyzed unprecedented plans for multi-university collaborations with the Coeur d?Alene Tribe and the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes for research and education programing, and provided for mechanisms to further expand tribal collaborations in Idaho?s future Track-1 project. Education and workforce development objectives focused on creating community-integrated projects and courses; environmental education, undergraduate research, and high-context engaged learning.

"Bacteria are an essential part of life on earth, but we do not really understand how they rapidly adapt to new environments. Genes in bacteria are not only inherited from parent to offspring but can also transfer between different species. This “horizontal gene transfer” is often caused by small genetic elements called conjugative plasmids. These plasmids carry the machinery to move copies of themselves into new bacterial cells. A gene on one of these plasmids can inhabit very different host cells over time. A mutation in this gene may then have different effects in each host. This means genes could evolve differently during parent offspring transmission than when they are transferred horizontally between species. This project combines mathematical models and experiments with different bacterial species to measure the effect of horizontal transfer on the evolution of an antibiotic resistance gene and determine how that influences adaptation to changing conditions.  Because antibiotic resistance genes are often located on these plasmids, this will aid in combating the evolution of drug resistance. Additional broader impacts include the development of learning tools and a new undergraduate course that will provide authentic research experiences for students. <br/><br/>This project has three research aims. First, the researchers will propagate communities with combinations of three bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and monitor the evolution of a plasmid-borne gene coding for resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Horizontal gene transfer will be manipulated during this process to determine the role of transfer between species in evolution of drug resistance. Second, genetically engineered bacteria will be used to determine why certain mutational sets are favored during horizontal transfer. Mathematically modeling of the results will produce predictions about whether horizontal transfer speeds or hinders the evolution of drug resistance. Third, the researchers will build a computational model to incorporate more realistic features of microbial communities, including more complex environments, migration, and competition between different bacterial species. This model will be tested in live bacterial communities with horizontal transfer turned on or off through plasmid engineering. Overall, this project will elucidate the role that horizontal genetic inheritance plays in the evolution of bacterial communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,140899.00,140899,4900,Evolutionary Processes,2142719,,Eva M Top,Office of Sponsored Programs,MOSCOW,US,ID00,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838443020,evatop@uidaho.edu,Eva,Top,fbmoore@nsf.gov,Paco Moore,7032925376,['01002223DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],01/28/2022,02/01/2022,01/31/2025,Collaborative Research: Adaptive Bridge or Barrier?

"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).<br/><br/>Yellowstone is an area where a mantle hotspot upwells beneath the continent causing volcanism and the region’s iconic geothermal features. In addition, the passage of the Yellowstone hotspot beneath the area is suggested to have caused larger scale landscape change by uplifting the regional topography. This project will test that theory by quantifying the erosion history of the Gallatin River, southwest Montana, over the last 6+ million years. The nature and strength of connections between mantle dynamics and Earth’s surface remains a broad question within the field of tectonics, and Yellowstone is an ideal location to study these interactions. The Gallatin River drains off the Yellowstone Plateau and records how the landscape has uplifted, eroded, and changed in response to the arrival of the Yellowstone hotspot in the region. Quantitative estimates of the erosion history on the timescales of tens of thousands to millions of years will be used to test hypotheses about which geodynamic processes contributing to topographic uplift. Results from the project will advance our understanding of the formation of the landscape in the Yellowstone region, an area that receives millions of visitors each year. In addition, the project supports a geoscience internship for underserved high school students from Idaho aimed at increasing the number of students who attend college and pursue technical degrees. The project also supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students at three institutions and helps to advance the careers of two early-career women faculty members. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to track the rates and evolution of incision, exhumation, and topographic relief in the Gallatin River drainage basin in southwest Montana during the approach and arrival of the Yellowstone hotspot in the region. The mountainous upper portion of the drainage is actively exhuming, whereas the lower portion contains a Miocene to Pleistocene sedimentary record of this exhumation, which is recently being incised. Bedrock low temperature thermochronology will be combined with detrital thermochronology from the basin and luminescence dating of river terraces to create a complete record of the tempo of incision and exhumation across timescales. These and other geologic observations will be integrated into a landscape evolution model to test hypotheses for patterns and drivers of surface uplift in the region. Research components include: 1) Apatite (U-Th)/He and 4He/3He thermochronology on valley to ridge transects of Cretaceous and Eocene intrusive rocks in the upper Gallatin drainage and integration with geologic constraints to quantify Cenozoic exhumation and relief evolution; 2) Mapping and luminescence dating of terraces along the transect of the Gallatin River to constrain Quaternary incision and deformation; 3) Detrital apatite fission track, U-Pb, and luminescence dating from Miocene and Quaternary sediments in the Gallatin valley to quantify exhumation rates over that timespan; and 4) Integration of geologic and chronologic data into a numerical landscape evolution model to test hypotheses and quantify magnitudes of surface uplift using an inversion scheme.

"Nonrenewable resources underpin our country’s critical infrastructure and as a result, many of our renewable resources are underutilized or wasted. The current housing economy operates on a model that damages the environment rather than a circular one that coexists with it. For example, buildings emit more than one-third of greenhouse gases globally and lumber mills producing housing construction materials currently convert only 40% of wood volume to lumber, leaving the remainder to be disposed of. This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaboration (RII Track-2 FEC) award will allow University of Idaho and Auburn University project teams to create a foundational framework to utilize renewable and waste feedstocks to make and utilize 100% bio-based materials for the Advanced Housing Manufacturing Industry of the Future. This project’s research activities and those developing the future workforce for this industry will be performed by a diverse interjurisdictional and interdisciplinary team, laying the foundation for transformational change in one of the country’s largest industries, housing construction. It will provide outreach to high school chemistry students and educate college undergraduate and graduate students, as well as mentor postdoctoral scholars and early-career faculty members. Two NSF EPSCoR states, Idaho and Alabama, will experience economic enhancements from this project’s technology developments and industry partnerships that capitalize on their strong timber industries.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to develop the science, technology, and educational frameworks required to enable an Advanced Housing Manufacturing Industry of the Future through the necessary intersection of unique interdisciplinary collaborations. Specifically, project teams at the University of Idaho and Auburn University will: 1) fractionate and characterize (via spectroscopy) bio-oils, chemically transform the oils into resins, and incorporate nanofibrillated cellulose to improve their properties; 2) develop additive manufacturing technology that is compatible with thermosetting type wood/bio-resin composites, incorporate reinforcing agents, such as biochar and long natural fibers, evaluate the properties of the composites via rheometry, thermal analysis, and spectroscopy, and 3-D print prototype building wall panels for evaluation; 3) evaluate, simulate, and predict composite material performance through ASTM tests, and incorporate fire and durability test data into neural network models to optimize material performance; and 4) promote housing construction market transformation toward more resilient building paradigms by developing resilience assessment tools for the architecture, engineering and construction industry and municipalities, and to develop curricular and pedagogical strategies for educating these stakeholders.

"A team of experts from five institutions (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Georgia Institute of Technology, Rochester Institute of Technology, Louisiana State University, and West Virginia University) are collaborating on further development of the Einstein Toolkit, a community-driven, open-source cyberinfrastructure ecosystem providing computational tools supporting research in computational astrophysics, gravitational physics, and fundamental science.  The new tools address current and future challenges in gravitational wave source modeling, improve the scalability of the code base, and support an expanded science and user community around the Einstein Toolkit.<br/><br/>The Einstein Toolkit is a community-driven suite of research-grade Python codes for performing astrophysics and gravitational wave calculations. The code is open-source, accessible via Conda (an open source package management system) and represents a long-term investment by NSF in providing such computational infrastructure.  The software is designed to simulate compact binary stars as sources of gravitational waves.  This project focuses on the sustainability of the Einstein Toolkit; specific research efforts center around the development of three new software capabilities for the toolkit: <br/>•  CarpetX -- a new mesh refinement driver and interface between AMReX, a software framework containing the functionality to write massively parallel block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code, and Cactus, a framework for building a variety of computing applications in science and engineering;<br/>•  NRPy+ -- a user-friendly code generator based on Python; and <br/>•  Canuda -- a new physics library to probe fundamental physics.  <br/>Integration of graphics processing units (GPUs) will incorporate modern heterogeneous computing devices into the system and will enhance the capability of the toolkit.  The end product is sustainable through integration into the Einstein Toolkit, yet also includes an active community maintaining and enhancing the foundational components.  Broader impacts are enhanced through training, documentation and a support infrastructure that reduces the barrier to adoption by the community.  The team is also creating a science portal with additional educational and showcase resources. <br/><br/>This award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation's Big Idea activities in Windows on the Universe (WoU).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,"47.049, 47.070",QWYKRJH5NNJ3,335902.00,272334,4900,WoU-Windows on the Universe: T,2227105,,Zachariah B Etienne,875 PERIMETER DRIVE MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,zetienne@uidaho.edu,Zachariah,Etienne,vchandol@nsf.gov,Varun Chandola,7032922656,['01002021DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],04/29/2022,10/01/2021,08/31/2025,Collaborative Research: Frameworks: The Einstein Toolkit ecosystem: Enabling fundamental research in the era of multi-messenger astrophysics,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,B,"['The Astrophysical Journal~2023~958~Zenati, Yossef and Krolik, Julian H and Werneck, Leonardo R and Murguia-Berthier, Ariadna and Etienne, Zachariah B and Noble, Scott C and Piran, Tsvi~https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/acf714~~~~~Bound Debris Expulsion from Neutron Star Merger Remnants~~~10515574~10515574~OSTI~2024-09-13 14:19:49.316~', 'Classical and Quantum Gravity~2023~41~Luo, Yufeng and Zhang, Qian and Haas, Roland and Etienne, Zachariah B and Allen, Gabrielle~https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6382/ad13c5~~~~~HPC-driven computational reproducibility in numerical relativity codes: a use case study with IllinoisGRMHD~~~10510411~10510411~OSTI~2024-06-19 09:31:26.606~', 'Physical Review D~2023~108~Ji, Liwei and Mewes, Vassilios and Zlochower, Yosef and Ennoggi, Lorenzo and Armengol, Federico G. and Campanelli, Manuela and Cipolletta, Federico and Etienne, Zachariah B.~https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.104005~~~~~Ameliorating the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition in spherical coordinates: A double FFT filter method for general relativistic MHD in dynamical spacetimes~~~10482386~10482386~OSTI~2024-09-13 14:21:18.826~', 'Physical Review D~2022~106~Lopez Armengol, Federico G. and Etienne, Zachariah B. and Noble, Scott C. and Kelly, Bernard J. and Werneck, Leonardo R. and Drachler, Brendan and Campanelli, Manuela and Cipolletta, Federico and Zlochower, Yosef and Murguia-Berthier, Ariadna and Ennoggi,~https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.083015~~~~~Handing off the outcome of binary neutron star mergers for accurate and long-term postmerger simulations~~~10426118~10426118~OSTI~2023-10-31 11:02:10.200~', 'Physical Review D~2023~107~Werneck, Leonardo R. and Etienne, Zachariah B. and Murguia-Berthier, Ariadna and Haas, Roland and Cipolletta, Federico and Noble, Scott C. and Ennoggi, Lorenzo and Lopez Armengol, Federico G. and Giacomazzo, Bruno and Assumpção, Thiago and Faber, Joshua a~https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.044037~~~~~Addition of tabulated equation of state and neutrino leakage support to illinoisgrmhd~~~10428914~10397642~OSTI~2024-02-16 19:04:04.366~']",
"The dynamic and changing nature of our planet has long been recognized by researchers in fields such as geology, climatology, and biology. Geological and climatological forces influence the formation and maintenance of biological diversity, and evidence from these disciplines is often used to understand these biological patterns. Yet, how signatures of current and past biodiversity patterns may inform geological and climatological models has often been overlooked. This project establishes the Island Systems Integration Consortium Research Coordination Network (ISIC-RCN), a consortium of geologists, climatologists, and biologists focused on determining the potential for each field to inform the others in novel, previously unexplored ways. To do so, the researchers will focus on the Galapagos Archipelago, an oceanic island system for which ample data have been assembled and that is ripe for such cross-disciplinary analyses. The ISIC-RCN participants will: (1) form a long-lasting community of researchers whose discipline-focused skills will spawn new interdisciplinary ideas and research directions; (2) quantify the current state of the knowledge about the geological, climatological, and biological understanding of these islands and of ocean islands around the world; and (3) move that understanding forward by addressing outstanding questions in new ways. Finally, the ISIC-RCN will extend its interdisciplinary framework to wider audiences in both the scientific and public spheres by maximizing the diversity of participants, conducting hands-on training in science communication, providing opportunities and tools to organize Galapagos outreach activities, and creation of a website to share Galapagos Research, ISIC-RCN scientific advances, outreach activities, and a student-led interactive learning app.<br/><br/><br/>The ISIC-RCN will use the Galapagos Archipelago as a model to leverage the power of cross-disciplinary research to address fundamental questions too challenging or impossible to address through single disciplinary approaches. Activities will align along three primary axes: (1) fostering a unique interdisciplinary community around island systems, using the Galapagos Archipelago as a focal point, (2) creating new research directions through cross-disciplinary collaboration, and (3) facilitating training and educational activities for scientists and the general public. To develop and maintain this novel scientific community, the ISIC-RCN will conduct a series of virtual and in-person meetings, facilitate data sharing and dissemination of scientific knowledge through a web-portal, and support the formation of working groups focused on specific cross-disciplinary scientific questions. Products of the ISIC-RCN include a new community focused on innovative research approaches, new collaborations, white papers on the state of the field and promising avenues of interdisciplinary research, and scientific publications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,499866.00,499866,4900,Systematics & Biodiversity Sci,2114466,,Christine E Parent,,,US,ID00,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838443020,ceparent@uidaho.edu,Christine,Parent,maime@nsf.gov,Cathie Aime,7032924572,['01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/22/2021,10/01/2021,09/30/2026,"RCN: Feedbacks between geological, climatological, and biological dynamics associated with the formation of the Galápagos Islands: The Island Systems Integration Consortium (ISIC)",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Lucinda P Lawson', 'Eric L Mittelstaedt']",E,,
"As environmental changes intensify around the world, both humans and wildlife face greater uncertainty and risk, threatening both human livelihoods and wildlife biodiversity. This research seeks to understand how multiple sources of stress impact humans, free-ranging livestock, and wildlife in shared rangelands in the western US. Increasingly frequent and more severe droughts make plant forage for wild herbivores and cattle less predictable and abundant, even as the return of gray wolves to parts of the landscape increases predation risk. As a result, wildlife such as deer and elk, as well as free-ranging livestock, may be forced to trade off food and security, and ranchers grazing their cattle on public land may face more uncertainty. This research will assess (1) how drought and wolves interact to affect wild herbivores and free-ranging cattle distributions across the landscape, (2) how decision-makers respond to these two sources of stress, and (3) how information, provided via a new wildlife and plant forecasting application, is received and used by both ranchers and wildlife managers. The project will also increase public awareness of human and wildlife connections and interactions in rangeland ecosystems via a documentary film, as well as by training citizen scientists to classify camera-trapped images of rangeland wildlife. A diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students as well as a post-doctoral researcher will be trained over the course of this project. Outcomes of this project include a better understanding of how climate and carnivore risks affect human decision-making, as well as how humans impact rangeland food webs via cattle stocking and wildlife removal, potentially leading to increased opportunities for coexistence between humans and wildlife in changing environments.<br/><br/>Ecological shifts brought about by climatic change can strongly interact with other sources of change, such as recolonizing large carnivores, to alter food web dynamics and potentially reduce ecosystem provisioning for humans. The uncertainty created by such interactions also challenges human decision-making. A critical gap exists in our knowledge of how climate change affects human-wildlife systems via wild food webs, and how natural resource decision-makers respond to such stress. We hypothesize that multiple environmental stressors (e.g., climate change and novel predators) will have complex and interactive effects on human-wildlife systems. Effects will likely occur via trophic interactions among predators, prey, domestic animals, and plants within shared food webs, potentially reducing the provisioning of humans from the shared ecosystem and human tolerance for predatory and competitive wildlife, and increasing uncertainty for natural resource decision-makers. There is a pressing need to advance models, tools and theory to (A) understand how multiple stressors interactively affect food webs in which humans and domestic animals are embedded, and (B) identify and quantify feedbacks among natural resource decision-makers and human-wildlife systems in response to multiple environmental stressors. Such information would assist in identifying potential “tipping points” in system resiliency and allow for better management of interacting wildland and agricultural systems. Using a factorial design of study sites across combinations of wolf presence and drought in Oregon and Idaho, we will study rancher-wildlife-plant dynamics. Data will stem from rancher surveys, wildlife camera grids, and ground-surveyed and remotely-sensed plant data. We will integrate social and ecological data into a structural equation modeling framework, which will drive ecological forecasts of predation and competition risk to livestock for ranchers and managers to use in future decision making. To understand natural resource manager decisions, which occur at larger spatial scales than rancher decisions, we will conduct a broad-scale analysis of the rangeland SES across the Western US using publicly-available wildlife and social data and remotely-sensed environmental characteristics. By analyzing decision-making across these spatial scales, we anticipate being able to identify key feedbacks, emergent phenomena, and potential tipping points in resilience for the human and wildlife components of the rangeland SES.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Dynamics of Integrated Socio-Environmental Systems (DISES) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,1597830.00,1597830,4900,DYN COUPLED NATURAL-HUMAN,2109005,,Chloe B Wardropper,"875 Perimeter Drive, MS 1136",Moscow,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,sophiegilbert@uidaho.edu,Sophie,Gilbert,ryuretic@nsf.gov,Richard Yuretich,7032924744,['01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/06/2021,09/01/2021,03/31/2023,"DISES: Cumulative effects of ecological and social stressors on the dynamics of integrated ranching-wildlife systems: drought, wolves, and human decision-makers",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Neil Carter', 'Jeremy T Bruskotter']",L,"['Journal of Hydrology~2022~607~Fanok, Lily and Beltrán, Bray J. and Burnham, Morey and Wardropper, Chloe B.~https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127531~~~~~Use of water decision-support tools for drought management~~127531~10349691~10349691~OSTI~2022-08-23 10:18:49.316~', 'Socio-Ecological Practice Research~2022~~Church, Sarah P. and Wardropper, Chloe B. and Usher, Emily and Bean, Liam F. and Gilbert, Ashlie and Eanes, Francis R. and Ulrich-Schad, Jessica D. and Babin, Nicholas and Ranjan, Pranay and Getson, Jackie M. and Esman, Laura A. and Prokopy, Linda S.~https://doi.org/10.1007/s42532-022-00121-x~~~~~How does co-produced research influence adaptive capacity?

"Unless first consumed by a predator, all animals enter the carrion pool when they die. Scavengers and microorganisms play a critical role in returning carcass-derived nutrients to the soil where they get recycled and used for plant uptake and growth. The impact of carrion inputs on nutrient cycling, food web dynamics, and ecosystem carbon balance remains a mystery. With global declines of many species including scavengers, it is essential to quantify how the quantity and quality of carrion-derived nutrients shapes plant community structure and ecosystem dynamics. Tasmanian devils are an ideal and charismatic species with which to study the effects of scavenging on ecosystem processes. They are one of a few carnivores worldwide that consume bones. By accelerating the cycling of key plant growth-limiting nutrients that would otherwise remain locked in bone material for years, Tasmanian devils provide a critical ecosystem function. In recent years, the emergence of a highly transmissible cancer — devil facial tumor disease, or DFTD — has dramatically reduced devil population sizes in eastern Tasmania and has spread throughout the island, threatening this iconic species with extinction. Researchers will use this tragic situation to test whether devil-scavenging impacts can be detected on an ecosystem scale and how devil population declines result in a shift in the role of other scavenger species. This project will provide training opportunities for US graduate students and post-doctoral scholars in an international setting. Through education and outreach activities, researchers will highlight the linkages that exist between scavengers, biodiversity, and ecosystem resiliency. <br/><br/>Few studies have directly investigated the effects of non-plant inputs on energy transfer within food web networks. As a result, there is a considerable knowledge gap in understanding how carrion and scavenger guilds govern biogeochemical cycling at an ecosystem scale. In Tasmania, the east to west spread of DFTD, a lethal, transmissible cancer, threatens devils with extinction and has created a population density gradient across the island (from 0% to 100% of carrying capacity). The resulting 'natural experiment' offers a rare opportunity to study how apex scavenger declines alter energy transfer within food webs and nutrient flows through carrion, soils, and plants. High-frequency monitoring and sampling stations will be established at five study sites that span the DFTD gradient and capture four experimental treatments: (1) full scavenger access (staked prey carcass); (2) devil exclusion (fenced prey carcass allowing access to all scavengers but devils); (3) reconstructed devil latrines to capture nutrient pulses from localized scat; (4) and soil-only controls to monitor background C and nutrient availability. Devil and mesopredator densities at carcasses will be estimated using camera arrays; invertebrate densities will be assessed using appropriate insect traps. Stable isotope tracing will be used to track how carcass-derived nutrients influence microbial community diversity and soil carbon formation. Plant productivity (NPP), leaf quality, seedling recruitment, and fine root biomass will be estimated at each site and across the continental DFTD gradient. Using temporal and spatial variation in the extent and timing of devil population declines, a series of scaled experiments will be used to: (1) determine how variation in scavenger densities affects local soil biogeochemistry; (2) investigate how carrion and scavenging networks induce shifts in the metabolic efficiency of microbial communities and decomposition rates of new plant litter inputs; (3) test the scale at which scavenging by devils is detectable; and (4) integrate findings from field and laboratory experiments to predict how biodiversity loss will affect ecosystem function over the next 50 years. The project will support a team led by an early-career female scientist, involve international collaboration and provide training at the graduate student and postdoctoral levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,677575.00,677575,4900,Ecosystem Science,2054716,,Laurel Lynch,875 Perimeter Dr.,Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838442340,llynch@uidaho.edu,Laurel,Lynch,mkane@nsf.gov,Matthew Kane,7032927186,['01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/27/2021,09/01/2021,08/31/2025,Collaborative Research: Effects of top scavenger declines—from microbes to ecosystems,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Michael S Strickland', 'Tara Hudiburg']",,"['Global Change Biology~2024~30~Stephenson, Torrey and Hudiburg, Tara and Mathias, Justin_M and Jones, Menna and Lynch, Laurel_M~https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.17413~~~~~Do Tasmanian devil declines impact ecosystem function?~N~~10530934~10522481~OSTI~2024-07-16 00:00:43.383~', 'FEMS Microbiology Ecology~2023~99~Osburn, Ernest_D and Moon, Cooper and Stephenson, Torrey and Kittipalawattanapol, Kawinwit and Jones, Menna and Strickland, Michael_S and Lynch, Laurel_M~https://doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiad085~~~~~Disturbance of eucalypt forests alters the composition, function, and assembly of soil microbial communities~N~~10531376~10444660~OSTI~2024-07-22 00:00:56.706~', 'Nature Microbiology~2024~9~Strickland, Michael S and Lynch, Laurel~https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-023-01576-8~~~~~Decomposer communities are universal in death~N~~10514023~10514023~OSTI~2024-08-07 18:17:55.643~', 'Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution~2024~39~Bartel, Savannah L and Stephenson, Torrey and Crowder, David W and Jones, Menna E and Storfer, Andrew and Strickland, Michael S and Lynch, Laurel~https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2023.09.008~~~~~Global change influences scavenging and carrion decomposition~N~~10530932~10530932~OSTI~2024-08-07 18:09:55.13~']",
"Mindat is a community-driven, free-access, online database that records information about all known mineral species and their worldwide distribution. Although all the data on the Mindat website are free for users to browse, the machine interface for data access and download has never been fully established. The OpenMindat project will, for the first time, allow automated querying and downloads from this data resource for academic research. This effort includes technical developments to establish open data access, research and training activities to advance data curation and data-driven geoscience discovery, and outreach activities to EarthCube and the broad geoscience communities. Opening the Mindat data for free academic use will encourage a new generation of research in geosciences as well as other disciplines. Mindat is already an important resource for geoscience education. Currently, it receives more than 3.5 million page views every month. These new data access tools in OpenMindat will make it easier for educational access to mineralogical data in the classroom, the laboratory, and even from home, allowing students greater opportunities to experiment with mineralogical data science. <br/><br/>The OpenMindat project will involve moving all appropriate Mindat data into an open science compatible license, building and operating a web-based platform for both automated queries and bulk data downloads, preparing all documentation on the use of this data, and building a suite of developer tools including packages in Python and R for direct data access from workflow platforms. OpenMindat will also deploy metadata standards to establish connections to EarthCube GeoCODES. The project will create several training positions and organize a list of engagement and outreach activities, with priorities given to underrepresented groups. Computational and statistical work on large mineralogy datasets has driven the recent studies in Mineral Evolution and Mineral Ecology of which the Mindat data was a critical component. OpenMindat will democratize this research allowing anyone wishing to utilize the Mindat data for research to do so immediately. Using machine learning techniques in combination with the OpenMindat dataset raises the possibility of finding previously unseen patterns in the mineralogical diversity on the Earth and beyond, such as, comparing the mineral assemblages and localities on Earth with other planets. This project will illustrate the importance of collecting and providing certain information when analyzing mineral samples and thus cause a cultural shift in mineralogical data collection and sharing. Likewise, the studies in this project will be an example for how rapidly scientific discovery can move forward when the data are in place and coupled with advanced analytical techniques and data science expertise.

"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).<br/><br/>The research team aims to produce long-term annually resolved well-replicated latewood tree-ring width data by generating regional TCP (tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes precipitation) reconstructions across the Southeast United States spanning the past approximately 300 years.  Longer TCP records (i.e., records that extend beyond the instrumental period) for the region could provide new information regarding: (1) past and current spatiotemporal characteristics of TCP variability; (2) the full range and amplitude of pre-instrumental TCP; (3) the historical precedence of recent large TCP producing storms such as Hurricane Harvey and Florence and, (4) the influence of oceanic and atmospheric forcing mechanisms on centennial-scale TCP variability and the sensitivity of TCP changes to these forcing mechanisms.<br/><br/>Landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs; tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes) impact coastal and inland communities due to strong winds, storm surges, and flooding caused by heavy rainfall.  While much research effort has focused on studying the magnitude and spatiotemporal variability of TC strength and landfall frequency across the southeastern U.S., the variability of rainfall derived from TCs for this region remains understudied. <br/><br/>This project seeks to provide new information on TCP in the Southeast through analysis of existing instrumental climate records and the development and application of multi-century tree-ring proxy records.   The overall objective for the research is to provide a paleoclimate reconstruction of TCP throughout the Southeast using a combination of old growth, older second-growth, and remnant stumps of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) throughout the range of the species. <br/><br/>The research team will test the hypotheses that: (1) the strong relationship between TCP and latewood growth of longleaf pine will allow for the development of a robust multi-century record that documents the spatiotemporal magnitude and variability of TCP within the Southeast U.S.; and (2) large-scale oceanic–atmospheric conditions will interact and exhibit substantive control over the timing and volume of TCP received in the Southeast.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include greater understanding of precipitation from tropical weather systems in the Southeastern United States, engaging undergraduate and high school students, many of whom are from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM (special needs students, native American students, first generation college students) in the research and outreach efforts, and science and technology transfer to the US Forest Service.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,128702.00,128702,4900,Paleoclimate,2102938,,Grant Harley,,,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838433021,gharley@uidaho.edu,Grant,Harley,dverardo@nsf.gov,David Verardo,7032924695,['010V2122DB R&RA ARP Act DEFC V'],07/21/2021,08/01/2021,07/31/2025,Collaborative Research: P2C2--Reconstructing Tropical Cyclone Precipitation throughout the Southeastern United States,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,"['Progress in Physical Geography: Earth and Environment~2023~47~Harley, Grant_L and Therrell, Matthew_D and Maxwell, Justin_T and Bhuta, Arvind and Bregy, Joshua_C and Heeter, Karen_J and Patterson, Thomas and Rochner, Maegen and Rother, Monica_T and Stambaugh, Michael and Zampieri, Nicole_E and Altman, Jan and Collin~https://doi.org/10.1177/03091333221147652~~~~~The Longleaf Tree-Ring Network: Reviewing and expanding the utility of <i>Pinus palustris</i> Mill.

"Boulders and large cobbles are ubiquitous roughness elements in mountain rivers and their presence provides vital ecological and hydromorphological functions. They are routinely used in restoration projects to increase habitat quality for many aquatic species because they impact on stream morphology by inducing erosional and depositional areas, whose size and extent depend on the boulder/cobble density, sediment inputs, and flow conditions during sediment mobilizing flows. However, little is known about the role of roughness element induced-streambed changes in regulating hyporheic exchange, which is the process moving stream water into and out of stream bed sediments to form the subterraneous hyporheic zone. The hyporheic zone promotes important biochemical transformations, which affect stream and pore water chemistries with implications at both local and global scales because it is a primary driver of bioactivity in streams and a key source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide, N2O. Sustainable management of water resources including river restoration (a $1B/year industry in the US) would benefit from knowledge of hyporheic processes to predict the effects of regulated flows, climate, and land use on ecosystems, nutrient cycles, and solute transport at the local and watershed scales. <br/><br/>The scientific goal for this project is to understand, quantify, and model the effects of boulder and cobble density and relative sediment supply during forming flows on hyporheic exchange, chemistry, and N2O production during low flow conditions. This will be addressed with flume and field experiments, supported by analytical and numerical modeling, and tested with hypotheses that boulder or cobble-induced changes in streambed morphology (1) have a primary role in regulating both the quantity and chemistry of hyporheic exchange at the reach scale, and (2) alter aerobic respiration, nitrification, and denitrification rates and increase the rates of apparent production and release of N2O.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,539714.00,539714,4900,Hydrologic Sciences,2100926,,Daniele Tonina,Office of Sponsored Programs,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,dtonina@uidaho.edu,Daniele,Tonina,jlawrenc@nsf.gov,Justin Lawrence,7032922425,['01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],06/07/2021,08/01/2021,07/31/2025,Collaborative Research: Changes in hyporheic exchange and nitrous oxide generation due to streambed alteration by macro-roughness elements,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Elowyn Yager'],J,"['Journal of Ecohydraulics~2023~~Monsalve, Angel and Yager, Elowyn M. and Tonina, Daniele~https://doi.org/10.1080/24705357.2023.2204087~~~~~Evaluating Apple iPhone LiDAR measurements of topography and roughness elements in coarse bedded streams~N~1 to 11~10439784~10439784~OSTI~2023-08-09 15:34:22.350~']",
"Microbes are found in all environments and play essential roles in nutrient cycling, gas exchange, and through associations with plants and animals. However, the ways that microbes are transported from one environment to another are not well understood. Each year, wildland fires emit millions of tons of smoke particles into the atmosphere and these particles likely carry microbes with them. Traditionally, wildfires have been studied in terms of direct impacts to terrestrial biota and the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere, but the role of smoke as an agent of biological dispersal has yet to be explored. Grasslands are one of the most widespread and frequently burned ecosystems, so this research will examine the impacts of smoke-driven microbial dispersal in tallgrass prairies of the central United States. Smoke sampling will be conducted using a combination of unmanned aerial vehicles flying into smoke plumes and  combustion experiments and soil incubations that mimic conditions in nature. This project uses an integrated approach to better understand the consequences of smoke to human, plant, and animal health across all environments where wildland fire occurs. The increasing size and severity of global wildfires, leading to increased interaction between biomass burning smoke and human populations, make this research relevant to a wide range of stakeholders including those interested in the potential transport of pathogenic microbes. In addition to mentoring three post-doctoral scholars, a graduate student, and undergraduate summer interns, the results will be disseminated to local communities through existing K-12 and informal learning programs at the Konza Prairie LTER and NEON sites. <br/><br/>Microbial emissions in smoke from biomass burning are both quantitatively and qualitatively different from the bioaerosols observed from wind-driven emissions, implying that wildland fire may be a globally relevant and yet-unquantified mechanism for microbial teleconnections among ecosystems. To test how smoke drives microbial metacommunity ecology, this project will use an integrated approach that compares the composition and viability of smoke source and sink microbial assemblages in field- and laboratory-based experiments. Smoke and particulate deposition during repeated prescribed fires in grasslands will be sampled over two years to characterize the relationships among fire behavior, meteorological conditions, and survival of microbes transported in smoke. Sterilized and untreated soils from similar, unburned sites will be exposed to contrasting dosages of smoke with known microbial content to compare the relative influence of selection, dispersal, and drift on soil microbial community assembly. These data will be used to build new capacity for simulating smoke microbial dispersal across scales by parameterizing microbial emission fluxes and microbial dispersion in atmospheric, chemical transport, and coupled fire-atmosphere models. Results will lend insight into the relative importance of stochastic vs. deterministic processes in driving microbial community ecology in systems where fire disturbances are frequent, while modeling will enable predictions of the scale and impact of smoke-related microbial dispersal. This research will inform questions about microbial gene flow, microbial pathogen epidemiology, phytopathogens, and meteorological processes, and will expand fundamental understanding of fire’s ecological significance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,443170.00,443170,4900,Population & Community Ecology,2039525,,Leda N Kobziar,"875 Perimeter Drive, MS 1139",Moscow,US,"ID""",University of idaho,ID,838441129,lkobziar@uidaho.edu,Leda,Kobziar,aporrasa@nsf.gov,Andrea Porras-Alfaro,7032922944,['01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],03/12/2021,04/01/2021,03/31/2025,Collaborative Research: Biomass burning smoke as a driver of multi-scale microbial teleconnections,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,N,"['Environmental Science &amp; Technology~2024~58~Kobziar, Leda N. and Lampman, Phinehas and Tohidi, Ali and Kochanski, Adam K. and Cervantes, Antonio and Hudak, Andrew T. and McCarley, Ryan and Gullett, Brian and Aurell, Johanna and Moore, Rachel and Vuono, David C. and Christner, Brent C. and Watts, Ad~https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c05142~~~~~Bacterial Emission Factors: A Foundation for the Terrestrial-Atmospheric Modeling of Bacteria Aerosolized by Wildland Fires~~~10496007~10487389~OSTI~2024-02-06 20:01:06.650~']",
"Kilauea volcano began a new phase of eruption on Dec. 20th, 2020 after ~1.3 years of repose. The beginning of the current eruption was fairly low risk to the community but that could change quickly, as it did in 2018. One factor that could help forecast if this eruption might transition into a higher risk eruption is the amount of hot, gassy, and crystal-poor magma that is reaching the surface. If the magma is colder, more crystalline, and degassed this suggests that the eruption is more likely to end soon. However, if researchers detect a change in the gas or crystal content during these early stages of the eruption, they can assume this means the magma chamber is producing new, hot and gassy magma instead of erupting old, degassed and crystal-rich magma. This project will sample volcanic gas and estimate the crystal content in an attempt to characterize the deep magma feeding this eruption as old (lower risk) or new (higher risk).<br/> <br/>The project will conduct investigations on the 2020 eruption at the Kilauea summit with the goal of capturing and correlating changes in the crystal content of the lava and gas geochemistry. The researchers will use one tried-and-tested method and one experimental method to build a dynamic picture of the early stages of this eruption through 1) gas collection, and 2) hyperspectral imaging. With these techniques, they will constrain the carbon isotope ratio of the gas (an indicator of young, fresh magma), the crystal content (an indicator of stagnated, older magma), and the eruption vigor. The potential contribution of this project is to inform the forecast of the likely behavior of the current activity as well as develop a new remote method which may lead to real-time crystal contents during an eruption. These values would be useful for lava flow modeling which helps civil defense plan evacuations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,78630.00,78630,4900,Petrology and Geochemistry,2125659,,Erika Rader,Office of Sponsored Programs,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,erader@uidaho.edu,Erika,Rader,jwade@nsf.gov,Jennifer Wade,7032924739,['01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],03/18/2021,04/01/2021,03/31/2025,RAPID: Kilauea 2020,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,,
"The aim of this project is to develop methods and apply them to better understand how cells can optimally perform more than one task simultaneously, such as to grow and to synthesize biofuels at high quantities and efficiently. These findings are expected to accelerate ongoing efforts that employ biological systems as factories to produce high-value chemicals, and, thus, contribute to a more sustainable bioeconomy. This project will also offer exceptional training opportunities to high school and undergraduate students underrepresented in science, with a focus on transferring the mathematical rigor of physical and engineering sciences to biology. Further, this project is highly interdisciplinary, thus offering exceptional training opportunities to graduate students towards professional careers that address multifactorial societal needs.<br/><br/>Systems biology has greatly improved our ability to program cells to perform a specific task. As the number of desired tasks increases, however, the complexity of biological systems restricts our ability to program or explore the foundation of cells that optimally perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This project will address this challenge via transformative microfluidic screening of combinatorial mutant libraries with single-cell resolution. Single-cell resolution will critically enable the selection of mutants directly from growing cultures, as well as quantify cellular noise. By applying the proposed method to an important biofuel platform and by combining the experimental results with genome-scale metabolic models, the project will generate fundamental knowledge on the genome-wide origins of multidimensional phenotypic traits and cell-to-cell phenotypic heterogeneity.

"Wildfire is increasing in frequency and duration in Western US forests because of longer fire seasons, greater fuel load, prolonged drought, and intense heat waves. In 2020, wildfires burned  existing research forests in Oregon, USA, creating the opportunity to study how and why fire kills some trees but not others. This research will investigate and track the fate of forest trees that suffered varying degrees of burn severity, determine reasons for tree death and survival, and use the knowledge to determine the impact of wildfire on forest recovery in similar systems across the western US. Knowing how trees survive fire and drought is important for land owners and policy makers in developing management plans for alleviating forest stress and for reducing the risk and impact of wildfire. This project will provide training for  a postdoctoral researcher, and contribute to a broader understanding of how fire and forest structure affect carbon and water cycling.<br/><br/>This research will provide critical knowledge about sensitivity of trees to varying fire severity, how traits of trees interacts with burn severity to impact survival, and how variability in tree mortality at the individual scale affects larger ecosystem processes, primarily net carbon balance.  This research will  quantify ecosystem response and recovery across a gradient of fire severity to answer this important research question: What are the immediate (weeks) and short-term (<1 year) impacts of wildfire on forest ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes, resilience, and mortality at tree, stand, and ecosystem levels? Post-fire data will be compared with the existing 20 years of continuous pre-fire data from the site, including eddy covariance, meteorology, subcanopy fluxes, automated soil respiration and sap flow on mature trees. Being able to characterize mechanisms for tree death and ecosystem recovery following fire is important for making predictions with process-based models of the impacts of fire at larger scales now and in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,69485.00,69485,4900,Ecosystem Science,2052571,,Tara Hudiburg,,Sisters,US,OR04,Metolius AmeriFlux Site,OR,977590001,thudiburg@uidaho.edu,Tara,Hudiburg,,Gary Lamberti,,['01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],10/26/2020,11/01/2020,10/31/2021,RAPID: Collaborative Research: In-situ forest ecosystem response to wildfire,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Crystal Kolden'],,," Forests remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in plant tissue and soils. This process of carbon uptake helps reduce greenhouse gases and climate warming. Forest carbon uptake and storage is affected by wildfire because trees can die or be injured. Wildfire is increasing in frequency and duration in the Western US forests because of longer growing seasons, fuels, drought, and heat waves caused by anthropogenic climate change. In 2020, wildfires burned through existing research forests in Oregon, USA creating the opportunity to study how and why fire kills some trees, how and why some trees survive, and how long it takes for the forest to recover. This research will investigate and track the recovery of forest trees, determine reasons for tree death and survival, and use the knowledge to determine the impact of wildfire on forest recovery and resilience in similar systems across the Western US. Knowing how trees survive fire and drought is important for landowners and policy makers in developing management plans for alleviating forest stress and for reducing the risk and impact of wildfire and drought.  Key outcomes of this work include significant advancement of knowledge about how conifers respond physiologically to fire. As of August 2021, &gt; 90% of the trees in the burn perimeter were still alive, including individuals that were severely damaged by the fire (i.e., nearly all the tree needles were scorched or consumed). Most of our study trees exhibited considerable degrees of physiological activity and had visible evidence of new growth. Nearly all trees exhibited budburst by June 2021 (see attached photo). Remarkably, we found that needle photosynthetic capacity (measured as the maximum velocity of carboxylation) increased with the severity of tree fire damage (R2 = 0.71, p = 0.02). Increasing photosynthetic capacity with tree damage suggests live needles on more severely burnt trees have an increased ability to fix carbon. This could be because of increased nitrogen uptake or nitrogen reallocation to surviving photosynthetic tissues, an area of future study. We also found that burned trees maintained higher leaf water potentials suggesting less water stress as the summer drought progressed.   One of our broader impact goals was to include and mentor as many trainees as possible from diverse backgrounds (we included a total of 2 students and 3 post docs). A key outcome of this effort is that we were able train an undergraduate biology student (female) who is now applying for PhD programs in forest carbon cycle science. A second key outcome is that we were able to mentor three postdoctoral researchers (two female), providing cross-disciplinary training in fire ecology, plant physiology, and carbon cycle science.    Results from this work have been presented at several scientific conferences and to the general public at local chapter meetings of the Idaho Native Plant Society and California Rotary clubs. A manuscript has been submitted for publication and several new proposals have been submitted by both the principal investigator and the postdoctoral researchers to continue to increase our knowledge of forest ecosystem responses to wildfire.

"The CIRCLES, Cultivating Indigenous Research Communities for Leadership in Education and STEM, Alliance is a partnership between six states in the western half of the U.S. (Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota , South Dakota, and Wyoming) to address the under representation of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) students in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines and workforce.  The AI/AN population within the states associated with the CIRCLES Alliance represents 10.5% percent of the nation’s AI/AN population.  With access to this population, the collective of STEM related activities, programs, and collaborations developed and implemented within these states through existing partnerships with tribal communities and with colleges that serve the tribes provides a path for increasing the success of AI/AN students through the combined Alliance.  This network of people, institutions, and communities along with the results of this project could serve as a national model for other states to follow.  The project will start by furthering conversations within tribal communities through interviews centered on STEM education in their communities and brainstorming ideas on how to combine efforts towards the success of students. It is then expected that these conversations will lead to tribal communities taking the lead in identifying projects, activities, and programs that are of greatest need to their students for STEM success.<br/><br/>The CIRCLES, Cultivating Indigenous Research Communities for Leadership in Education and STEM, Alliance is a partnership between six states in the western half of the U.S. (Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota , South Dakota, and Wyoming) to address the under representation of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) students in the STEM disciplines and workforce.  The preparation, cultural, and access reasons for this this low representation require organically grown and trusted partnerships, which are in place within the participating states. The AI/AN population within the states associated with the CIRCLES Alliance represents 10.5% percent of the nation’s AI/AN population. Subsequently, the development and implementation of integrated formal and informal STEM activities within these states through already existing partnerships with tribal communities and tribal colleges provides a pathway for increasing the engagement, involvement, and success of AI/AN students within this network and could provide a national model for scaling to other states. The CIRCLES Alliance looks to increase the knowledge gained by the combined effort of states that will collectively engage and impact AI/AN communities through conversation, interviews, and relationship building between tribal entities and EPSCoR jurisdictions. As part of these growing relationships, tribal communities will take the lead roles in identifying STEM projects and programs that have been successful and in developing programs that are determined to be of greatest need in the STEM education of their students to produce a STEM-ready workforce that fits into the economic development plans of their respective communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.083,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,76051.00,76051,4900,EPSCoR Research Infrastructure,2038371,,Philip Stevens,875 Perimeter Dr.,Moscow,US,ID00,University of Idaho,ID,838443020,pstevens@uidaho.edu,Philip,Stevens,jswanson@nsf.gov,J.D.

The CIRCLES Alliance conducted 52 personal interviews and 43 online surveys with tribal members in our respective states to learn more about Indigenous views of science and math as well as successes and challenges in STEM within tribal communities.  Participants also identified a number of strategies for creating environments that promote Native students' learning, strengths, and skills:   Incorporation of more culture and Indigenous knowledge in STEM classrooms so that students feel more included and course content is more relevant to them   Development of more Indigenous knowledge-based curriculum in STEM and professional development opportunities for both Native and non-Native educators   Increased learning for teachers about Native cultures, backgrounds, and histories   Opportunities for K-12 teachers to obtain the skills and tools they need to teach basic science and math subjects more effectively    More Native mentors, role models, and teachers   Improved communication during K-12 grades about STEM career pathways and tribal community needs regarding STEM-related professions    Additional STEM jobs based in the community    Increased support programs to assist with college preparation and transitions into non-tribal higher education institutions    These strategies have informed the future direction of the Alliance to help address the disparity in STEM education and the workforce with Indigenous populations.  Another important outcome is the continued conversations on how to approach the above strategies from an Indigenous point of view.  The Alliance strives to address these through an Indigenous framework centered on 7 R?s ? Respect, Responsibility, Relationships, Relevance, Representation, Reciprocity, and Resilience.  However, competing viewpoints still exist from Western expectations and viewpoints and those from an Indigenous lens.  There is still a need to create space for Indigenous voices and ways of knowing to lead and guide the Alliance pathway. This means honoring Indigenous values and processes, ensuring that all work centers accountability to communities, and that structures and systems are designed to let communities drive the process rather than the project. This includes the need to be flexible and responsive, rather than imposing a program, and being able to deeply listen to community voices, which takes time and commitment.  Learning how to best address this within the structure of an Alliance is an ongoing process that will continue within the Alliance states.

"Tick-borne diseases (TDs) account for a staggering 94% of human illnesses due to vector-borne diseases in the U.S. The mission of this project is to assimilate disparate datasets with spatio-temporal, environmental and human predictors and to leverage cyberinfrastructure and data science to enhance forecasting of TDs in the western US. The core members of this project are from universities in three EPSCoR jurisdictions: University of Idaho, University of Nevada, Reno, and Dartmouth College (New Hampshire). The collaboration will build capacity across traditional boundaries of research and practice, with an aim to change the way people tackle TDs. Building upon the best practices and standards for open data, the findability and reusability of the assimilated datasets will be improved to enable new analyses and findings. Accordingly, the contributions of this project will have broad and sustained impacts on TD, a public health issue of national importance. With the early-career faculty mentoring activities, this project will increase the pool of academics and practitioners in a collaborative network for improved prediction and informed response to TDs in the western US. The digital games and demos released by the project will help improve the awareness of TDs among the general public. The efforts of this project will also support underserved and largely rural populations at high risk of TDs. All the training programs, including postdoc and graduate student positions, will give priority to women and underrepresented minority groups. Through the national Big Data innovation ecosystem, this project will add a new community of practice via shared deliverables, datasets and complementary knowledge to improve monitoring and forecasting of TDs across US and the world.  <br/><br/>This project will contribute to NSF’s big ideas on Harnessing the Data Revolution and Growing Convergence Research through data-intensive research for improved prediction of TDs. The central scientific hypothesis is that, climate change will increase the prevalence of TDs throughout the western US, both through altering the geographic and seasonal distributions of ticks as well as interacting factors of environment, ecology, socioeconomics, and human behavior. The project team will collect and develop application-level datasets, knowledge graphs, tools, and innovative data science methods to advance the understanding of factors, patterns, and risks for TDs in the western US. The research includes three focused scientific objectives: (1) An advanced framework for TD research: Sparse data collection and FAIR framework, workflow provenance, and algorithms for a data life cycle; (2) Identify the changing patterns in tick importation routes, pathogens, and TD dynamics in the West; and (3) Develop spatio-temporal models of tick dynamics that link TDs to climate, environment and socioeconomic factors. The team will incorporate expertise in complementary disciplines to generate enriched open data, promote innovation and capacity in big data analytics, and develop training, education and outreach programs for sustained impact. Through the teamwork, the research will produce fresh understanding of the interacting factors in TD dynamics. Resources and mentoring to support early-career professionals will build towards sustained productivity. We will bring state-of-the-art knowledge and skills to postdocs, students and other practitioners to nurture a new workforce. This collaborative project will engage academic, state, federal and local partners to create a connected and smart network to tackle TDs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.083,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,5830709.00,6430179,4900,EPSCoR RII Track-2 FEC,2019609,,Xiaogang Ma,875 Perimeter Drive,Moscow,US,ID01,University of Idaho,ID,838449803,xgmachina@gmail.com,Xiaogang,Ma,pbentzvi@nsf.gov,Pinhas Ben-Tzvi,7032928246,"['01002223DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002324DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002021DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",08/19/2020,09/01/2020,08/31/2025,RII Track-2 FEC: Leveraging Big Data to Improve Prediction of Tick-Borne Disease Patterns and Dynamics,Cooperative Agreement,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Barrie Robison', 'Xun Shi', 'Frederick C Harris']",,"['Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences~2022~9~Nguyen, Quang-Huy and Nguyen, Tin and Le, Duc-Hau~https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2022.801931~~~~~Identification and Validation of a Novel Three Hub Long Noncoding RNAs With m6A Modification Signature in Low-Grade Gliomas~~~10327818~10327818~OSTI~2022-05-27 17:03:27.56~', 'Computers &amp; Geosciences~2022~159~Sun, Ziheng and Sandoval, Laura and Crystal-Ornelas, Robert and Mousavi, S.

"Fluid flow through biological tissues are challenging to accurately measure, model, and simulate because of their complex geometries and varying length scales. To address these research challenges, a high-resolution and mixed-material three-dimensional (3D) printer will be acquired. The proposed 3D printing technology uses jets of liquid photopolymer layers as thin as 16 microns to build high-resolution models of biological tissues. It will also enable novel combinations of rigid and soft materials in specific concentrations and structures in one printed model. The printer will advance ten innovative research areas that are under investigation by four interdisciplinary teams that include nine faculty from six departments in four colleges. The printer will support research in lung, spinal cord, brain, aneurysms, and in understanding the mechanical properties of tissues at multiple scales and fluid-tissue interactions. The experimental data with synthetic tissues will be used to validate numerical simulations of fluid-tissue interaction models. In addition to training graduate and undergraduate students, the printer will be used in 3D-printing competitions for local K-12 students, and high school students when they attend Women in Engineering Day on campus, which will broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in engineering, science, physics, and technology.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to advance knowledge of biofluids and biomechanics by the ability to analyze complex physiological multiscale tissue structures, and especially improve fundamental understanding of these distinct topics of interest: (1) mechanisms of lung ventilation including the study at each anatomical level of the lung, from the microscale respiratory zone to the macroscale conducting zone; (2) cerebrospinal fluid drug delivery, in vitro bioreactor investigation of brain cancer drugs, a therapeutic approach for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury; (3) experimental fluid-tissue interactions using transparent models with precise and independent control of the surface roughness, fluid dynamics parameters, mechanical properties, and geometrical parameters; and (4) how the underlying micro- and macroscale collagen organization and structure regulate the bulk mechanical properties of musculoskeletal tissues with the development of 3D biomimetic tissue models.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by CBET-MRI Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,252542.00,252542,4900,Major Research Instrumentation,2019231,,Tao Xing,"875 Perimeter Dr., MS 0902",Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838440902,xing@uidaho.edu,Tao,Xing,hchellia@nsf.gov,Harsha Chelliah,7032927281,['01002021DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],08/25/2020,09/01/2020,08/31/2023,MRI: Acquisition of a 3D Printer for Studying Biofluids and Biomechanics,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Gordon Murdoch', 'Vibhav Durgesh', 'Nathan R Schiele', 'Bryn Martin']",,,"  This project has enabled the acquisition of a high-resolution and mixed-material three-dimensional (3D) printer for the construction and testing of complex structures that support STEM research, especially on biofluids and biomechanics.

"As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. The goal of this  pilot and feasibility study  is to increase participation in informal STEM learning in rural Idaho through Stories of Fire, a program based on personal narratives of wildland fire. Idaho is a rural state, with an average population of just 19 people per square mile, the fourth lowest population density in the United States.  The state is experiencing increasingly severe wildfire, and effective responses to such environmental change require a better understanding of the underlying science.  Contextualizing science learning, making connections between everyday lives and a sense of place can engage learners and bring about a better understanding of wildfire.   This project will bring together a science communicator, a narratologist, a fire ecologist, and a specialist on emotions and public lands.  They will work collaboratively with informal educators based in rural areas of Idaho underrepresented in STEM fields.  Rural areas are rich in knowledge based on years of cumulative observations, cultural beliefs, and practices shared through community networks. This project builds on these rural assets while addressing the challenges rural populations face. The project addresses broadening participation in STEM through narrative practices that encourage more diverse ways of knowing, being, and representing science.<br/><br/>This research study will  explore: 1) what mechanisms of narrative (storytelling)  most effectively integrate individuals’ personal  experiences and accurate STEM content in fire science communication, and 2) what audience-centered approaches best facilitate narrative approaches to informal STEM learning. This project engages four levels of participants over four phases of research and programming: 1) The research team will interview and analyze the narratives of 40 Frontliners (e.g., wildland firefighters and evacuees) from the inland Northwest region with first-hand experience with wildfire. 2) They will conduct a narrative workshop to train 20 informal STEM Educators from across the state on audience-centered approaches that facilitate participant storytelling about fire. 3) Educators will pilot their own narrative-based informal science learning programs with program participants in their rural home communities across the state,  4) A professional podcaster will create two podcasts modeled on our research findings for public audiences reached through media.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.076,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,299911.00,299911,4900,AISL,2006101,,Leda N Kobziar,1800 University Lane,McCall,US,ID01,University of Idaho McCall Field Campus,ID,836381025,lkobziar@uidaho.edu,Leda,Kobziar,,Sandra Welch,,['04002021DB NSF Education & Human Resource'],06/29/2020,08/01/2020,07/31/2022,Stories of Fire: Integrative Informal STEM Learning through Participatory Narratives,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Jennifer K Ladino', 'Erin James']",N,"['Fire~2022~5~Ladino, Jennifer and Kobziar, Leda N. and Kredell, Jack and Cohn, Teresa Cavazos~https://doi.org/10.3390/fire5020053~~~~~How Nostalgia Drives and Derails Living with Wildland Fire in the American West~~53~10381464~10381464~OSTI~2022-11-23 10:44:05.96~']"," The Stories of Fire project explored the efficacy of using personal narratives of wildland fire to increase participation in informal STEM learning (ISL) in rural informal education contexts in the Northwestern US.

Fire adaptation outreach programs can benefit from integrating storytelling, or narratives, in informal education programming. Our interdisciplinary team, including three graduate students, a science communicator, a fire ecologist, a narratologist, and a specialist in affect studies, worked with interpreters and rural residents to share stories about living with fire and its increasing impacts as the climate warms and fire and land management change. Through interviews, narrative analysis, ISL program design and implementation, and a podcast, we specifically examined 1) fire knowledge conveyed in personal narratives of fire, and 2) what audience-centered approaches best facilitate participant storytelling in informal STEM learning.   We focused on the ways stories, or narratives, convey fire knowledge. When we listened closely to rural residents’ stories in our interviews with them, we learned that they have strong and sometimes contradictory emotions about fire, including awe, fear, respect, and nostalgia for times prior to burning or for times when fire was managed differently. In some stories, elements of fire science emerged, reflecting various types and degrees of knowledge about fire’s natural role in the region’s ecosystems. We also learned that rural residents, the ecosystems they live in, and their interactions with fire are diverse. For example, some rural residents feel comfortable with fire and the use of prescribed burning as a cultural and agricultural stewardship practice; but others are more fearful and prefer to suppress or avoid fire interactions. We utilized our narrative interviews with rural residents of Idaho to examine the features of their narrative-based fire knowledge. Our analysis suggests that storied fire knowledge 1) centers human timescales, 2) privileges localized fire dynamics, and 3) reveals complex human relationships with fire.  Drawing from these results, we developed informal education programs about fire based on integrating both fire science and similar fire narratives. We worked with interpreters and informal educators in state parks and environmental education centers around Idaho to deliver these educational programs in places that reflect the cultural and ecological diversity of our region. We used the educators' feedback, as well as the experiences of participants in these programs, to refine a participatory storytelling framework for fire programs. Based on survey results and focus groups from this pilot project, we learned that interpreters and participants found these participatory storytelling programs engaging and productive of new knowledge. We suggest that engaging narrative epistemologies in public outreach can support situating this multi-scalar phenomena in local contexts of salience to residents, re-integrating affective and scientific dimensions, and diversifying epistemologies valued in dialogues about fire adaptation.  In addition to training 30 informal educators in five rural areas of Idaho in participatory storytelling methods, narrative theory, and fire science, Stories of Fire programming reached at least 324 participants at Ponderosa State Park, the McCall Outdoor Science School, Craters of the Moon National Monument, and Q’emlin State Park. We additionally supported Nez Perce Tourism to conduct culturally-embedded fire science programming and to build fire knowledge among educators and program participants, including Nez Perce youth. Now, additional research is needed to assess the effectiveness of participatory storytelling programs more broadly. We describe our interdisciplinary, community-based process as a ""confluence"" of experiences, knowledge, and ideas, alongside a shared intention of moving forward together in adapting to the changing social and physical landscape of wildland fire.

"The evolution of novel traits can change the way that organisms interact with their environments to survive, grow and reproduce. Deep knowledge of the underlying genes and developmental changes that underly most evolutionary innovations is sparse, as is understanding of the ecological consequences for both the organisms in which novel traits emerged and the organisms with which they interact in communities. A particular gap in understanding is how the evolution of novel traits influences the biodiversity of their associated microbial communities. This project will help fill this gap in our knowledge by studying a remarkable innovation – male pregnancy in seahorses, pipefish and seadragons. This project will include the creation of new genome sequences and detailed studies of the developmental genetic underpinnings of the embryo brooding structures that make male pregnancy possible. The consequences of pouch evolution on the complexity and function of the community microbes in the pouch will also be studied, as well as how this unique host-associated microbiota can affect the fitness of embryos in the pouch. This project will provide research training to high school students, teachers, and undergraduates from underrepresented groups through immersive outreach and targeted support programs. The project will also support training of the next generation of scientists via education of Ph.D. students and postdoctoral scholars. Outreach to general public will be accomplished through public talks and through creation of a museum exhibit on syngnathid biology paired with web resources to support K-12 education.<br/><br/>Male pregnancy, accompanied by morphologically diverse embryo brooding structures, is a defining evolutionary innovation in syngnathid fishes. The goal of this project is to build an integrative understanding of the developmental genetic origin of this remarkable syngnathid novelty and its role in mediating multi-level ecological interactions with host-associated microbiota. This project will include production of 19 new annotated reference genomes strategically sampled across the syngnathid lineage, morphogenetic analysis and transcriptional/epigenetic profiling of the developing pouch in a comparative framework that leverages the repeated, independent evolution of complex brooding structures in the family, and analysis of brood pouch biocomplexity as a determinant of pouch-associated microbiome assembly. When complete, this project will provide novel insights into genome structural evolution in syngnathids, identify protein sequence and gene regulation changes involved in brood pouch development, and address whether the evolution of the brooding tissues created specialization in host regulation of microbiota with consequences for brooded progeny. The work will attract new researchers to syngnathids for studies of evolutionary innovation and diversification. The project will provide research training to high school students, teachers, and undergraduates from underrepresented groups, and will support education of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, including the opportunity to take intense short courses to learn next generation sequencing, bioinformatics, complex statistical analyses, and genome editing. Educational outreach to general public will be accomplished through public lectures by the PIs, and through creation of a museum exhibit on syngnathid biology, which will be paired with an associated web resource directed toward K-12 education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,586223.00,586223,4900,Evolution of Develp Mechanism,2015419,,Adam G Jones,875 Perimeter Drive,Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838444264,adamjones@uidaho.edu,Adam,Jones,akallen@nsf.gov,Anna Allen,7032928011,"['01002021DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",08/17/2020,08/01/2020,07/31/2025,Collaborative Research: RoL: The evo-devo of male pregnancy and its effects on the brood pouch microbiome,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,G,"['Gigabyte~2023~2023~Ramesh, Balan and Small, Clay M. and Healey, Hope and Johnson, Bernadette and Barker, Elyse and Currey, Mark and Bassham, Susan and Myers, Megean and Cresko, William A. and Jones, Adam Gregory~https://doi.org/10.46471/gigabyte.76~~~~~Improvements to the Gulf pipefish Syngnathus scovelli genome~~~10413836~10413836~OSTI~2024-09-15 12:22:36.813~']",
"Sexual selection is an important evolutionary mechanism that results in the evolution of extravagant ornaments, strong mating preferences, and differences between the sexes. Sexual selection also sets the stage for sexual conflict, a situation in which the evolutionary interests of the two sexes fail to coincide, resulting in traits or genes that can be beneficial to one sex but harmful to the other sex. While the effects of sexual selection and conflict on traits are well understood, little is known about how these mechanisms affect the genome. A key test of theory relating sexual selection, sexual conflict and genome evolution would entail genome comparisons in groups of related species in which some have had a history of strong sexual selection and some have had a history of weak sexual selection. In this project, the researchers will use seahorses and the related pipefishes to conduct such a test. Seahorses and some pipefishes are monogamous with long-term pair-bonds, and this mating system results in weak sexual selection and little sexual conflict. Other pipefishes have independently evolved polygamy (multiple mating by one or both sexes), which results in strong sexual selection and substantial conflict. The researchers will apply modern sequencing methodologies to delineate the impacts of sexual selection and conflict on genome evolution in these species. This project has significance well beyond seahorses and pipefishes, as many species, including humans, have had a recent evolutionary history involving sexual selection and conflict. This history can explain why the sexes are different at the level of the genome and why the same gene can have different effects in the sexes. This project will also train a new generation of graduate students and undergraduates in cutting-edge genomic techniques and statistical methodologies. In addition, it will expand the pipefish and seahorse research community by offering week-long workshops and a new wealth of publicly available genomic data.<br/><br/>The project will involve a total of twelve taxa, including three seahorses and nine pipefishes, chosen for their phylogenetic relationships and known patterns of sexual selection. The seahorses (genus Hippocampus) and three of the pipefish species (genus Doryrhampus) are monogamous with pair-bonds, and the other six pipefish (three each from the genera Syngnathus and Nerophis) are polygamous with a history of strong sexual selection. The project will involve (1) the complete sequencing of the genomes of all twelve taxa, (2) comparative transcriptomics, which will examine patterns of sex-specific gene expression, and (3) comparative population genomics, which will detect contemporary genome-level selection. Data will be integrated across these three levels of approaches to understand the genome-level effects of sexual selection and sexual conflict in light of evolutionary theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,1028242.00,1036360,4900,Evolutionary Processes,1953170,,Adam G Jones,Office of Sponsored Programs,MOSCOW,US,ID01,University of Idaho,ID,838449803,adamjones@uidaho.edu,Adam,Jones,lrissler@nsf.gov,Leslie J.

"This study will reconstruct summer air temperatures over the past 1000 years using tree-ring data in an area where these data do not currently exit.  Using a novel “blue-light” proxy for tree-ring analysis, this project will provide solid contributions to the field of dendrochronology. Understanding the broader temporal and spatial patterns, timing, and amplitude of current and past cool and warm periods provides a framework to better understand future environmental disruptions in the study region. These data and the environmental reconstructions produced by this research will be hosted at the International Tree-Ring Data Bank and NOAA World Data Center for Paleoclimatology so that they are readily accessible to the public, as well as other researchers. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a graduate student to establish an independent research career.<br/><br/>Current and future changes in temperatures may have negative impacts on natural and human systems and high-resolution temperature reconstructions are needed to understand current and longer-term environmental change. The spatial variability of historic temperature trends is not fully understood, and this lack of knowledge limits model forecasts. This research will improve understandings of the historic spatial and temporal variability of summer temperatures across the western United States. It uses novel methods applied to tree rings to develop temperature records that provide information on (1) past and current spatiotemporal characteristics of temperature variability, (2) the full range and amplitude of historic temperatures, and (3) the timing and direction of temperature rate changes.

Increased temperatures will place stress on natural and human systems upon which the large and growing centers of human population across the western US depend. Within the Northern Hemisphere network of annual temperature proxy records (e.g. tree-rings), one of the most obvious spatial gaps is the western US, where few temperature reconstructions exist. Because paleo estimates of temperature across this region are scarce, it is difficult to determine the context of projected conditions.  This research developed a network of temperature-sensitive tree-ring records not only across the Intermountain West, but also across the US Rocky Mountains (southern, central, and northern Rockies), Cascade Mountains and into southern British Columbia, and Sierra Nevada mountains of California using newly established methods of blue light intensity (BI). The network currently includes 82 individual site BI and ring-width collections across these regions. We used this new network to produce 4 regional reconstructions of growing-season (summer) maximum temperatures that represent the spatial temperature variability not only across the low-to-mid latitudes of the western US, but also throughout southern Canada and northern Mexico. The 4 reconstructions show similar evidence of warm and cool periods but differ with regards to the onset, duration, and intensity of these periods. Over the common period of all 4 regional models (1730-2018), trends in between-group synchrony of temperature anomalies show patterns of spatial dependence. For example, the Intermountain West and Southern Rockies regions show the highest between-group synchrony, and the Northern Rockies and Southern Rockies show the least. Notable periods of increasing synchrony across all 4 records include the latter half of the 20th century, specifically the Dust Bowl, and the period between the Dalton Minimum and the terminus of the Little Ice Age (LIA) in the middle 1800s. The strongest decline in overall synchrony between the 4 regions occurs around the turn of the 20th century following the LIA (ca. 1880-1920).  This doctoral dissertation research provided teaching experience and training of an early career scientist from an underrepresented group. Methods and results from this research were incorporated into Introduction to Planet Earth laboratory assignments, as well as hands-on activities for elementary and middle school science classes from the northern Idaho region. Tree-ring and blue light intensity data generated by this research added much-needed data points to the Northern Hemisphere temperature proxy network. Proxy data/reconstructions are publicly available via the International Tree-Ring Data Bank and NOAA World Data Center for Paleoclimatology. Research results from this project are currently published in 1 doctoral dissertation at the University of Idaho and 7 peer-reviewed journals, and project results were presented via 8 invited talks and/or scientific meetings.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in untold challenges to personal and public health, largely because scientists and clinicians know very little about the virus that causes it and how transmission occurs. Whereas respiratory droplets are known to be a major mode of transmission, it is very likely that there are other sources. One understudied possibility is transmission from mother to infant via breastfeeding. Although researchers know that some viruses can be passed from mother to infant in this fashion, almost nothing is known about SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). For this reason, there is substantial confusion as to whether breastfeeding is safe and/or beneficial when a mother is known to be infected. This study will provide fundamental information about this basic biological property of SARS-CoV-2, information that will be immediately usable by women, healthcare providers, and public policy makers. This study will investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be detected in breast milk produced by infected women. Results will provide needed information about potential spread of the disease between breastfeeding mothers and infants as compared to formula-feeding mothers and infants. This topic is urgent because women continue to give birth and breastfeed during the pandemic, and guidance is critically needed. The Broader Impacts of this project include both outreach to the public to inform breastfeeding mothers about breast-feeding choices, and education of an undergraduate and graduate student.<br/><br/>Although respiratory droplets are a known source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, other modes likely exist. One such possibility is SARS-CoV-2  vertical transmission during breastfeeding, but little is known about this type of transfer for any coronaviruses. For SARS-CoV-2, there are only a handful of studies that report analysis of milk produced by COVID-19+ women; all but three report no evidence of virus in milk. There is similarly limited research on the effects of maternal milk antibodies on infant immune responses and severity of symptoms. As a result, there is substantial confusion as to the risks and benefits of breastfeeding for SARS-CoV-2+ mothers. This proposed research is a longitudinal, repeated-measures study of 25 breastfeeding mothers and infants and 25 formula-feeding mothers and infants. Dyads will be recruited within 7 days of maternal COVID-19 diagnosis and followed for 2 months during which time milk and breast swabs will be repeatedly collected (from breastfeeding mothers) and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using an RT-qPCR; milk will also be analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Stool samples will also be collected and analyzed to assess viral exposure/shedding; and dried blood spots collected and analyzed to assess viremia and antibody (IgG and IgA) titers. Results will immediately inform women, healthcare providers, and public policy makers regarding infant feeding choices during the postpartum period.

This is because some pathogens (e.g., HIV, Zika, M. tuberculosis) can be vertically transferred from mother to infant via human milk. In response, initial guidance from some, but not all, authoritative bodies (e.g., US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics) recommended that SARS-CoV-2-infected breastfeeding women be separated from their infants and refrain from direct breastfeeding their infants. However, all guidance at that point was not evidence-based because there was very little evidence either supporting or refuting vertical transmission. At the time we began this study, there were 12 published studies on the topic, 11 of which found no evidence that the virus could be detected in milk produced by SARS-CoV-2-infected women. None of these studies used adequate methods of milk collection and analysis. In addition, milk contains myriad protective components (e.g., antibodies), and only one study had been published reporting the presence/absence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in milk. Our study found that milk produced by infected mothers does not contain SARS-CoV-2 and is a source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 activity. Milk-borne SARS-COV-2 antibodies persisted in most women for at least two months. These results support recommendations encouraging lactating women, with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, to continue breastfeeding during and after illness. Additionally, results from our study are the first to prospectively examine SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in infants following maternal infection outside of the neonatal period. We found that exposed breastfed infants do not appear to be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to other (non-breastfed) household children and adults. These findings further support previous research demonstrating minimal risks to infants following maternal COVID-19 infection, including for breastfeeding infants.

"Space optical communication (SOC) can provide orders-of-magnitude higher data rates than its Radio-Frequency (RF) communication counterpart and promises to be a key technology for space communication networks. However, limitations to developing SOC yet to be overcome include: 1) the atmospheric channel is dynamic and not well-understood, preventing its statistical characterization; 2) the traditional communication system design ignores full use of relevant information from real-time data; 3) the complexity of the systems required to achieve the performance gain of SOC (over RF) would increase rapidly, hence SOC engineering solutions must incorporate the complexity as a constraint. To address these challenges, this research develops a systematic design framework which combines model-based and data-driven design paradigms for SOC and where the system 1) models and predicts the long-term dynamics of the atmospheric channel, and 2) proactively adapts its communication and networking strategy to the dynamics of the environment, thereby maximizing end-to-end system performances in terms of data rates, energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency, and link reliability. The proposed approach will demonstrate how SOC can be a reliable platform that complements existing technologies to fulfill the requirements of easy deployment, high data rates, and affordable complexity of future systems. Potential benefits of the project include deploying broadband internet via optical drones in poor countries, thus enabling access to information and education; ensuring connectivity between aircraft, thus improving the safety, reliability, and efficiency of air travel; and enhancing the reliability of space exploratory missions, thus increasing our potential for discovery. The research effort will be integrated with the principal investigator's educational career goal of promoting undergraduate research, encouraging enrollment of high-school students in STEM and recruiting underrepresented students by working with the institution's existing diversity recruitment and support programs.<br/><br/>Current communication systems are either difficult to deploy at large scale or limited by the RF spectrum licensing burdens. This project's contributions are significant because they show, via a mix of theoretical and practical frameworks, how SOC can be a reliable platform that complements and enhances existing technologies. The first objective of the research is to derive the performance limits of SOC, which describe the best error probability and channel capacity that a well-designed system can achieve in various relevant settings such as multiple access and relay channels, and accounting for atmospheric impairments. To mitigate the atmospheric effects, a sharp statistical channel model will be devised. The work will encompass deep-space, near-earth and space system networks. While deep space communication is well described via the Poisson channel model, the effects of the atmospheric attenuation and pointing error could be captured via statistical models. Depending on the communication scenarios, an input-dependent or an input-independent Gaussian noise could also be incorporated. The methodology to undertake this objective is based on applying tools from information and communication theories along with a non-parametric statistical channel learning approach. The second objective is to develop powerful machine learning techniques to perform signal classification, estimate parameters of the atmosphere, determine the mapping between input and output data and infer probability distributions in order to design communication systems that can efficiently perform without relying heavily on channel models. Block structure Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based as well as end-to-end DNN-based designs, for point-to-point and multiuser settings, will be considered. The methodology to undertake this objective relies mainly on designing SOC auto-encoders with gradient-free optimization techniques and block structure DNN-based channel estimation, signal classification, and detection.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Communications, Circuits and Sensing Systems (CCSS) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,500000.00,404095,4900,CCSS-Comms Circuits & Sens Sys,1944828,,Zouheir Rezki,"875 Perimeter Drive, MS 3020",Moscow,US,ID00,"Regents of the University of Idaho, Office of Sponsored Programs",ID,838443020,zrezki@ucsc.edu,Zouheir,Rezki,,Zhengdao Wang,,['01002021DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],01/21/2020,03/01/2020,02/28/2021,CAREER: Advancing Space Optical Communication Systems Via Hybrid Model-Based and Learning-Based Frameworks,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,,
"Material properties are often linked to the atomic structure and chemistry of its internal interfaces. Among the internal interfaces, heterointerfaces are boundaries separating two materials with different atomic structure and chemistry. The atomic structure and chemistry of these heterointerfaces are complex and cannot be easily predicted from the individual materials that form the heterointerface. This complexity increases exponentially in multi-component heterointerfaces as it involves a vast number of chemical possibilities at the interface. Thus, designing the chemistry of a novel multi-component heterointerface with a targeted material property is a challenging task. This research project aims to enhance our current capability to determine the chemistry of a multi-component heterointerface with a targeted electronic property for photovoltaic applications using a combination of electronic structure calculations and machine learning approach. Machine learning tools can substantially reduce the time needed to identify the chemistry of a heterointerface that meets a desired electronic property need by efficiently extracting hidden chemistry-property relationships, a key factor toward accelerated discovery of novel heterointerface. The proposed project addresses the important federal government mandate of Materials Genome Initiative, the objective of which was to substantially reduce the time and cost to discover, manufacture, and deploy advanced materials.<br/><br/>Multicomponent heterointerfaces have long intrigued materials scientists and physicists, in part, because of the sheer complexity of their atomic and electronic structure and chemistry. Such complexity can make designing a novel multi-component heterointerface with a targeted material property a non-trivial task. This is because navigating the vast combinatorial chemical and configurational possibilities between multiple elements at the interface is simply too large. This research project aims to design the chemical composition of a heterointerface for photovoltaic application with a targeted electronic property using a combination of electronic structure calculations and machine learning approach. More specially, the PI plans (a) to develop an in-depth understanding of the underlying physics that determines the electronic and atomic structure of the heterointerface using electronic structure calculations; and (b) to apply machine learning tools to explore hidden chemistry-property relationships of the interface, to predict the chemistry of the heterointerface for a desired electronic property. The proposed approach is a departure from the traditional time-consuming and expensive Edisonian trial-and-error approach of synthesis-testing experimental cycles; thus, it can substantially accelerate materials discovery. The PI anticipates that upon completion of this project a generic computational template to investigate structure-chemistry-property relationship of highly complex multi-component heterointerfaces will be generated.  Finally, machine learning will be an integral part of future materials discovery. The knowledge gained from this project will help train student(s) on machine learning tools and their utility in materials research, increasing their exposure early in their careers to this growing and influential materials science field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.083,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,152050.00,152050,4900,EPSCoR Research Infrastructure,1929206,,Samrat Choudhury,P.O.

"This project is aimed to address a grand challenge in data-intensive materials science and engineering to find better materials with desired properties, often with the goal to enhance performance in specific applications. This project addresses this grand challenge with a specific focus on finding metal organic framework (MOF) materials that are used to separate gas mixtures and finding better battery materials for energy storage. The PIs will combine theoretical methods from statistical mechanics and condensed-matter physics, and physics-based models, to generate information-rich materials data which is integrated with generative machine learning (ML) algorithms to search a complex chemical design space efficiently and to train deep learning models for fast screening of materials properties. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary collaboration involving researchers from physics, materials science and engineering, computer science, and mathematics. The resulting multidisciplinary environment fosters training the next generation data savvy scientists who will engage in collaborative multidisciplinary research.  <br/><br/>Existing approaches for computational design of metal organic frameworks (MOF) and solid-state electrolyte materials are largely based on screening of known materials or enumerative search of hypothetical materials. This project develops a new approach that integrates first principles calculations, experimental data and abundant data generated by physics-based models to train generalized antagonistic network (GAN) models for efficient search of the materials design space, and to train deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models for fast and accurate screening of properties of the GAN-generated candidate materials. Additionally, graph-based GAN models will be used for MOF topology exploration and can be applied to other nanomaterials designs. More specifically, the investigators will: 1) develop and exploit physics-based models for fast calculation of properties such as diffusivity, ion conductivity, and mechanical stability; 2) develop generative adversarial network (GAN) models with built-in physics rules for efficient exploration of the chemical design space for both MOF materials and solid electrolytes; 3) use persistence homology and Bravais lattice sequence representations of MOF materials and solid electrolytes, respectively, to build Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) models for fast and accurate prediction of the physical properties of generated materials; 4)  apply high-level quantum-mechanical calculations for verification of discovered materials. Accomplishments from this project will lead to accelerated discovery of novel nanostructured materials for gas separation and energy storage, materials for lithium-ion batteries, novel data-driven scheme for materials design, and theoretical methods enabling implementation of advanced data science techniques. The highly interdisciplinary collaboration will offer students unique opportunities to interact with a variety of disciplines, and training the next-generation scientists with the mindset for multidiscipline collaborations.

A graph neural network model for predicting physical properties of metal-organic-framework materials. Graph neural networks are one of the most successful machine learning models because of their &#64258;exibility and effectiveness in describing 3D structural data. However, they often focus on topological structure and oversimplify geometric structure. Our model integrates rotational invariance of 3D molecular structures of materials into the model, enabling users to make better predictions.  2. A metric-learning framework for high conductor screening. Electrode and electrolyte materials with high room-temperature Li-ion conductivity play key roles in developing high-performance batteries. Accurate prediction of material conductivity is important for building technology and is of significant scientific interest. The challenge of developing a machine learning model for high conductor screening is the lack of validated conductor samples for training. We used a Siamese network to map material structures to an optimized feature space, then used an instance-based method to effectively classify the highly imbalanced data. Our model can be used to rapidly screen candidate materials, avoiding the high computational cost of physics-based methods.  3. A double autoencoder for imputation of missing values in a data table. Missing values are ubiquitous in all sciences. Previous imputation methods used either column-column or row-row relationships, but not both, to impute missing values in a data table. We developed a model that can simultaneously and collaboratively use both column-column and row-row relationships to impute the missing values, thus achieving better performance.  4. SepNet, a deep learning architecture specifically designed for directionally correlated tensor data. Directionally correlated tensor data are very common in applications such as multichannel signals, spectrograms, and hyperspectral data. In SepNet, we built the directional correlation information of such data into the model architecture, thus significantly improving the network efficiency compared with state-of-the-art convolutional neural network models. Furthermore, SepNet can be flexibly constructed with minimal restrictions on the output shape of each layer, making it easy to adapt to different problem settings.  Through this project, we also developed methods for data-aware customization of activation functions, which are a key component of neural networks. We proposed the use of an even activation function in neural networks for predicting target functions with some degree of symmetry, which appear in diverse applications, and demonstrated that it can significantly reduce prediction errors.

"Seventeen million years ago, Earth's climates gradually heated up and then stayed warm for several million years. This event is termed the mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO) and it was the last global warming event before the Ice Age. Still, what caused the warming and how it affected plants and animals remains unclear. This project uses plant fossils preserved in lake sediments in Washington, Idaho and Oregon to study how ecosystems changed during the MMCO. Specifically, the researchers will investigate whether CO2 (a greenhouse gas) emitted from Pacific Northwest (PNW) volcanoes during the mid-Miocene helped heat the atmosphere, how climate changed in the PNW, and how local plant communities adjusted to these changes. Mid-Miocene ecosystems were similar to today; therefore, learning about the MMCO helps predict what may happen to today's ecosystems experiencing climate change. Several graduate and undergraduate students are being trained, and a new display featuring MMCO research in the Burke Museum is being created. <br/><br/>This project examines the causes and effects of mid-Miocene warming through the study of 18 exceptional PNW paleofloras from before, during and after the MMCO. Together, the floras form a sequence of linked data on atmospheric pCO2, regional climate change, and vegetation that can be precisely dated. The floras often preserve macrofossils, pollen, and phytoliths, providing an integrated view of local and regional climate and vegetation. Project aims are to: (1) do high-precision U-Pb geochronology on volcanic ashes at 13 floral sites across the MMCO; (2) study plant assemblages at all 18 sites to infer (a) vegetation composition, diversity, structure, and successional stage, (b) local-regional climate, and (c) atmospheric pCO2; and (3) use these data to evaluate the nature and timing of PNW ecosystem change during the MMCO. The project will contribute to a biogeographically more resolved understanding of how the Earth climate system and vegetation respond during global warming events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,108245.00,108245,4900,Sedimentary Geo & Paleobiology,1924856,,Leslie L Baker,875 Perimeter Drive MS 3022,Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443022,lbaker@uidaho.edu,Leslie,Baker,yyanes@nsf.gov,Yurena Yanes,7032922649,['01001920DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/09/2019,09/01/2019,08/31/2024,"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: TRACKING PCO2, REGIONAL CLIMATE, AND VEGETATION CHANGE DURING MID-MIOCENE GLOBAL WARMING THROUGH THE EXCEPTIONAL PLANT RECORDS OF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, USA",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,L,,
"Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) is one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas. NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, and integrates the co-production of knowledge. This award fulfills part of that aim. <br/><br/>Temperatures in the Arctic are rising rapidly, and these warmer temperatures have caused permafrost, ground that remains frozen for at least two consecutive years, to warm and thaw. Permafrost coasts, which make up approximately 30% of the world's coastlines, are experiencing accelerated erosion due to thawing. Erosion at some locations has occurred at the rate of 16 m per year since 2007. Degradation of permafrost and related coastal erosion damages coastal infrastructure and facilities across the Arctic, impacting the economic prosperity and lives of its inhabitants. As critical infrastructure becomes vulnerable to permafrost degradation and erosion, residents are forced to abandon homes and entire communities must be relocated.  This diverts resources from other critical needs and disrupts social networks and subsistence practices. This research addresses society's capacity to adapt by analyzing interactions among the natural environment, social systems, and the built environment, in a part of the Arctic where coastal erosion due to permafrost degradation is taking place. This project co-produces knowledge with Arctic indigenous communities and will share research outcomes to inform decision-making with local communities and the general public. The project promotes NSF's initiative of Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (INCLUDES) by involving local indigenous high school students in the collection of field data, providing workshops in local communities demonstrating how science and engineering can improve community well-being, and provides students and early-career researchers with training and capacity-building opportunities in convergent research. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the complex relationship between permafrost degradation and related coastal erosion, civil infrastructure, and community well-being, including social and cultural resilience. Results can be used to formulate a holistic and predictive model that aids adaptation of social systems and the built environment to the unprecedented environmental changes in the region. The project consists of five research tasks with related research products: (1) development of a thermal model with high spatial resolution (130 m) to evaluate and predict the rate, extent, and mechanisms of permafrost degradation in the next century and a maximum entropy principle model to estimate the future rate of coastal and river bluff erosion and thermokarst development; (2) creation of an infrastructure hazards map of the region experiencing the effects of permafrost degradation and coastal erosion; (3) co-production of knowledge with Arctic indigenous communities to identify and understand the most urgent issues relating to permafrost degradation and coastal erosion and flooding, as well as collecting and integrating local long-term observations of these phenomena by local observers; (4) development of a quantitative assessment model of sociodemographic resilience of communities to permafrost degradation, demonstrating the impacts of infrastructure disruptions on the social resilience and adaptation capacity of coastal communities; and (5) development of an agent-based model (ABM) that can be used to adapt civil infrastructure and build the social resilience of communities to future permafrost degradation and coastal erosion. The project works with communities along the coastal region of Alaska North Slope Borough (NSB) to develop and validate models, although results will be of value to many coastal communities experiencing permafrost-induced coastal erosion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,449355.00,449355,4900,NNA-Navigating the New Arctic,1927713,,Lilian Alessa,,,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838442481,alessa@uidaho.edu,Lilian,Alessa,robdelga@nsf.gov,Roberto Delgado,7032922397,['01001920DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],09/11/2019,09/01/2019,08/31/2025,NNA Track 1: Collaborative Research: Resilience and adaptation to the effects of permafrost degradation induced coastal erosion,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,"['The Air Force journal of IndoPacific affairs~2021~4~Alessa, L.~~~~~~Asymmetric competition in the Arctic: Implications for North American defense and security~~1-28~10335279~10335279~OSTI~2022-08-14 01:24:36.520~', 'The International Journal of Intelligence, Security, and Public Affairs~2021~23~Alessa, Lilian and Moon, Sean K and Valentine, James and Marks, Michael and Hepburn, Don and Kliskey, Andrew~https://doi.org/10.1080/23800992.2021.2006954~~~~~Surprise and Suspense: How the Intelligence Community Forgot the Future~~310 to 342~10335278~10335278~OSTI~2022-08-14 01:24:36.526~', 'Cold Regions Science and Technology~2023~214~Wang, Ziyi and Xiao, Ming and Liew, Min and Jensen, Anne and Farquharson, Louise and Romanovsky, Vladimir and Nicolsky, Dmitry and McComb, Christopher and Jones, Benjamin M. and Zhang, Xiong and Alessa, Lilian~https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2023.103969~~~~~Arctic geohazard mapping tools for civil infrastructure planning: A systematic review~~~10436102~10436102~OSTI~2024-05-21 09:55:00.706~', 'Geographies~2023~3~Alessa, Lilian and Valentine, James and Moon, Sean and McComb, Chris and Hicks, Sierra and Romanovsky, Vladimir and Xiao, Ming and Kliskey, Andrew~https://doi.org/10.3390/geographies3030027~~~~~Toward a Permafrost Vulnerability Index for Critical Infrastructure, Community Resilience and National Security~~~10450256~10450256~OSTI~2024-05-21 09:53:00.70~', 'Journal of Marine Science and Engineering~2022~10~Liew, Min and Xiao, Ming and Farquharson, Louise and Nicolsky, Dmitry and Jensen, Anne and Romanovsky, Vladimir and Peirce, Jana and Alessa, Lilian and McComb, Christopher and Zhang, Xiong and Jones, Benjamin~https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse10030422~~~~~Understanding Effects of Permafrost Degradation and Coastal Erosion on Civil Infrastructure in Arctic Coastal Villages: A Community Survey and Knowledge Co-Production~~~10318969~10318969~OSTI~2024-08-28 18:52:11.566~']",
"The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on PhD matriculation and completion.  BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, namely to ""foster the growth of a more capable and diverse research workforce and advance the scientific and innovation skills of the Nation.""  The vision of this grant is to provide a national model to produce underrepresented scientists and engineers with doctoral degrees in STEM.<br/><br/>The performance site for this LSAMP BD Activity is the University of Idaho (UI), one of the 35 college and universities included in the All Nations Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ANLSAMP).  The UI has its home on the ancestral homelands of the Nez Perce people, and is in close proximity to the traditional homelands of numerous Federally recognized Tribes both in Idaho and in the Northwest.  The uniquely positioned project will bring to the forefront Indigenous values and ways of knowing to support Tribal sovereignty and self-determination through developing and seeking to understand culturally responsive educational pathways in which Indigenous scholars can thrive, from the baccalaureate to doctoral degrees.  The project will be grounded in the core values of Indigenous methodologies for research, training and mentoring and builds on the success of recruitment, mentoring, and community-building lessons learned from ANLSAMP and campus programs which have demonstrated success with Native American students.  The program will solely support LSAMP Native American students, which are historically underrepresented in the STEM disciplines, by providing: 1) culturally responsive recruitment which is connected to existing LSAMP and other Native American focused undergraduate programs and involves the prospective students' whole community; 2) an intensive community-based orientation to graduate school; 3) support for students financially and through a culturally-responsive mentoring model; 4) activities designed to support strong mentee/mentor relationship; 5) monthly seminars and professional training and support for both students and their faculty mentors; and 6) culturally responsive research projects grounded in an understanding of Indigenous Knowledge and Western science.  In due course, the model created and researched through the ANLSAMP BD at UI will lead to a significant increase in Native American PhDs entering academics, government, and the private sector.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.076,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,1074990.00,1074990,4900,Alliances-Minority Participat.,1906157,,Cumer S Green,104 Morrill Hall,Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443017,scottgreen@uidaho.edu,Cumer,Green,ljones@nsf.gov,Leroy Jones II,7032924684,"['01001920DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '04001920DB NSF Education & Human Resource']",07/24/2019,08/01/2019,06/30/2023,LSAMP BD: University of Idaho - All Nations LSAMP,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Jerry R McMurtry', 'Yolanda Bisbee']",S,," The LSAMP Bridge to Doctorate program at the University of Idaho was successful in recruiting a cohort of 12 PhD students in STEM disciplines. The cohort of students who are part of the University of Idaho LSAMP Bridge to Doctorate represent tribes from California to North Carolina and from Mexico to Canada. The Bridge to Doctorate scholars are enrolled in programs which will lead to them completing doctoral studies in the following disciplines: Natural Resources, Geology, Mechanical Engineering, Entomology, Climate Science, Wildlife Biology, Fisheries Science, Soil Science, and Environmental Science.     Of the original 12 students recruited, two left the program early due to either family responsibilities back home or challenges with adjustment to the university environment. Both will be welcomed back when they are ready.  Additionally, one left with a master’s degree to pursue a career in industry which he determined was the best path for him and his family, the other left for a different institution to pursue a PhD in an adjacent field of research.  Two additional students (Warm Springs and Mayan) were recruited into the cohort for a total of 10 pursuing Ph.D.’s at the point of the final report.  Of the ten, three are scheduled for preliminary exams in 2023 and the balance in academic year 2024-25.     Overall, the project advanced what is known about providing comprehensive and relevant support for Indigenous doctoral students as well as a better understanding among faculty on how to mentor and co-learn with Indigenous scholars and use Indigenous knowledge to advance science. The project allowed both the mentors and scholars ways and techniques which allowed exploration in how traditional and Indigenous knowledge can inform and add context and understanding to Western science ways of knowing. Two activities were key to the development of an understanding of traditional Indigenous knowledge and mentorship/relationship building between mentor and scholar. The first is the Indigenous Mentoring Program (IMP) which as designed to train faculty in understanding Tribal Knowledge and Indian Education, Tribal Sovereignty, Tribal Nation Building, Indigenous Research Methodologies, and Cultural Humility. The IMP was a required component of the award and all faculty mentors were ask to participate and complete the training. Outcome reports from the training clearly show the impact it had on the faculty understanding Indigenous knowledge and research methodologies as well as the importance of connecting in a culturally humble, relevant, and responsible fashion with individuals, tribes and tribal communities. The second activity is the Indigenous Knowledge Field Camp (IKFC) which paired the mentor and scholar and took them through activities which demonstrated the deep historical knowledge held by tribal elders and communities and how the knowledge is actively being applied in tribal agencies, organizations, and communities. The IKFC exposed faculty to the importance of language in understanding Indigenous knowledge and how language must be preserved to fully understand the Native ways of knowing. The IKFC created a desire in both mentor and student to go more deeply into the observational data of natural phenomenon which has guided Indigenous science since time immemorial. The camp demonstrated how each Indigenous scholar’s tribal knowledge from their homeland was more similar than different, even though the tribal communities may have been thousands of miles apart.     Each scholar was mentored through a bi-weekly seminar which continued to build community and relationships between the scholars. The seminars and social activities, which were attended by both scholars and mentors, included activities on traditional Nez Perce land foraging for traditional foods, hikes, skiing, and other activities which were all on un-ceded tribal land in North Idaho. The scholars and mentors were coached on how to develop and submit proposals for prestigious fellowships. In the second year of the project four scholars submitted proposals and won 2 GRFP honorable mentions, one GRFP win, and a HHMI Gilliam Fellowship.     The faculty mentors met with the project director monthly to discuss support strategies and ensure each student was making satisfactory progress. Faculty who are serving as mentors for the scholars valued to time together to learn and further develop their shared understanding of Traditional Knowledge and each scholars path to their program.     Native American students make up the lowest percentage of all groups represented in graduation education. At the PhD level, Native Americans students represent less than one percent of all PhD's awarded.  In the STEM disciplines the numbers are significantly less as most PhD's awarded to Native American students are in social sciences or humanities. What we have learned about supporting Native STEM students who are pursuing doctoral studies will be disseminated as we hope to inform other institutions as to what we have learned and discovered about recruiting, supporting, retaining, and graduating Native American scholars with STEM PhD degrees and assist them as they move into the professoriate and industry and become inspirational leaders for their home communities.

"The movement of rocks along river beds, called sediment transport, is essential for estimating river channel stability and therefore risks to infrastructure and human lives during floods.  Sediment transport predictions are also used to help restore rivers for numerous aquatic species. Despite its importance, sediment transport is notoriously difficult to predict, and this project will investigate how changes in river bed structure (e.g. rock arrangement) influences sediment transport. Such information will then be used to improve sediment transport predictions. Through a collaboration with artists, sculptures will be temporarily placed in rivers to serve as 1) flow obstructions (e.g. boulders and wood) that provide habitat for a range of fish species, and 2) public outreach installations through signs posted near the sculptures with links to websites containing information and videos about the science of this project. <br/><br/>Errors in sediment transport predictions can be partly explained by the common assumption that the onset of sediment motion always occurs at the same flow magnitude in a given river. Large temporal changes in the onset of sediment motion can occur because of variations in the channel bed structure. The goals of this proposal are to better understand these temporal changes in bed structure and to use this understanding to accurately predict the onset of sediment motion.  Laboratory experiments and a mechanistic theory are used to identify and quantify the channel bed parameters that control variations in the onset of sediment motion.  This theory will be tested using field measurements in a well instrumented channel and could replace the often arbitrary choice of a single flow magnitude that causes the start of sediment movement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,348957.00,382753,4900,XC-Crosscutting Activities Pro,1921790,,Elowyn Yager,,Moscow,US,ID00,University of Idaho,ID,838443020,eyager@uidaho.edu,Elowyn,Yager,jlawrenc@nsf.gov,Justin Lawrence,7032922425,"['01001920DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",05/14/2019,07/01/2019,06/30/2025,A mechanistic and predictive understanding of temporal variations in the onset of sediment motion,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,"['Earth Surface Processes and Landforms~2024~49~Hodge, Rebecca_A and Voepel, Hal_E and Yager, Elowyn_M and Leyland, Julian and Johnson, Joel_P_L and Sear, David_A and Ahmed, Sharif~https://doi.org/10.1002/esp.5842~~~~~Improving predictions of critical shear stress in gravel bed rivers: Identifying the onset of sediment transport and quantifying sediment structure~N~~10518524~10514821~OSTI~2024-06-15 00:04:56.726~', 'Earth Surface Processes and Landforms~2024~49~Yager, Elowyn_M and Shim, Jaeho and Hodge, Rebecca and Monsalve, Angel and Tonina, Daniele and Johnson, Joel_P_L and Telfer, Luke~https://doi.org/10.1002/esp.5822~~~~~Pro+: Automated protrusion and critical shear stress estimates from 3D point clouds of gravel beds~N~~10518527~10498963~OSTI~2024-06-11 00:01:36.400~']",
"The seemingly endless chain of high mountains and deep valleys of the northern Rocky Mountains has sparked wonder in visitors since Lewis and Clark looked across it from the continental divide. The goal of this research is to understand when this dramatic landscape formed and how mountains fall apart, a process that is still active in the western U.S. today. The principal investigator and her students are using ancient rainwater, preserved for millions of years in volcanic ash, to measure elevations from the past 50 million years across Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, combined with the ages of sediments that have filled the valleys over time, to reconstruct the history of mountain building and collapse in the northern Rocky Mountains and Basin and Range. Through this project, the researcher aims to increase accessibility to geoscience for students of all levels. Students benefit from direct support for graduate and undergraduate research projects, development of widely accessible, hands-on investigative Google Earth activities for undergraduate courses, and summer internships for high school students from underrepresented groups, recruited via STEM Access and TRIO-Inspire programs. The project supports to broadening of representation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields through direct research support of an early career female geoscientist researcher and her students, and through the Tuff Talk podcast, which provides distance mentorship, coaching, and professional development to a broad audience through interactive interviews with successful women in Earth science. This research also uses a novel combination of analytical techniques in geochemistry and age dating, with the goal of refining these methods.<br/><br/>Elevated regions have an outsized influence on regional hydrology, global climate, erosion and deposition of sediment, and many other Earth processes. Orogens can maintain high topography well after the end of crustal shortening or mantle delamination, despite high gravitational potential energy and thermal weakening of the lithosphere. Although estimates of the timing of uplift have recently become common, we lack precise surface records of orogen collapse, even in the well-studied North American Cordillera. Measuring the timing and pace of surface lowering, and its effects on erosion and basin sedimentation, can provide us with insights into the drivers for that extension, and into the genesis and structure of the original orogen. The overall objective of this research is to reconstruct the Cenozoic evolution of topography across the North American Cordillera, including the timing, magnitude, and mechanisms of surface-lowering, conglomerate deposition, and drainage reorganization, thereby generating a holistic model of orogen collapse as expressed in the surface record. The principal investigator and her students quantify changes in surface topography by combining an innovative, widely distributed stable isotope proxy material with precise radiometric ages, and interpreting those data using an isotope-enabled global climate model to capture changes in elevation over time. Paleoelevation measurements are integrated with new provenance, exhumation, and sediment lag time data from the basin record to determine the onset of extension and test if surface deformation generated widespread conglomerate deposition. Results are used to discriminate between various potential mechanisms for orogenic collapse and to develop a model for the interactions between, and surface expressions of, core complex formation, slab rollback, and magmatism. Through the combination of multiple field and analytical datasets and the integration of findings, the project team is gaining a new understanding of the progression of North American Cordilleran surface lowering and the conditions necessary to initiate range-wide extension and lithospheric thinning.

"In 1928, Alexander Fleming identified the antibiotic properties of penicillin. Since this discovery antibiotics have been a boon for human health as well as for agricultural livestock production. In fact, the latter utilizes 80% of the antibiotics produced in the United States, a staggering 33 million pounds a year. Most of these antibiotics and antibiotic derivatives ultimately enter the environment, leading to the assertion that no environment on earth is free from the influence of agricultural antibiotics. Despite this, little research has examined the environmental influence agricultural antibiotics are likely to have, for example, on soil microbial communities and the ecosystem processes they mediate. This research will determine the effect antibiotics have on soil food webs and ecosystem processes both now and in an uncertain future. While examining the environmental implications of antibiotics, this project will include training at the graduate student and postdoctoral levels, and develop an authentic, expeditionary style curriculum that can be integrated across multiple middle schools which enables students to actively participate in research. <br/><br/>Using a combined set of survey, field, and lab experiments this research will determine: 1) biogeographic patterns of the soil resistome (i.e. the collection and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes); 2) the implications of antibiotics for soil food webs and ecosystem processes; and 3) the interaction between antibiotic inputs and temperature changes. Soil microbial communities are central to the healthy functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. However, these communities are likely to be markedly affected by antibiotic inputs derived from exogenous sources. For instance, antibiotic inputs may alter microbial efficiency leading to lower ecosystem carbon and nutrient retention, affect soil food web structure and community interactions, and potentially influence the response of soil microbial communities to global environmental change. This research is designed to investigate the potentially important, but under-studied, role antibiotic inputs have on terrestrial ecosystems. Additionally, this research seeks to better understand the susceptibility of particular soil communities and ecosystem function to antibiotic perturbation. The results gained from this research will lead to a more complete understanding of the potential impact antibiotic inputs have on soil community structure and function, and the implication of these inputs in the future. In addition to training a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher, the educational component of this project will expose middle school students -- a student population that is at a critical juncture in deciding their lifetime career objectives, but often not actively engaged in science -- to multiple curricular modules that aim to increase their knowledge of soil, microbial, and ecosystem ecology. These young students will also be active participants in the project by collecting data and conducting research directly related to the scientific objectives of this project.

In fact, the latter utilizes 80% of the antibiotics produced in the United States, a staggering 33 million pounds a year. Most of these antibiotics and antibiotic derivatives ultimately enter the environment, leading to the assertion that no environment on earth is free from the influence of agricultural antibiotics. Despite this, little research has examined the environmental influence agricultural antibiotics are likely to have, for example, on soil microbial communities and the ecosystem processes they mediate.      This project yielded comprehensive results illustrating the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and the interactions between antibiotics, land-use, and global change factors. First, this research highlights that human impacted systems support a higher abundance and diversity of ARGs compared to less impacted systems. Second, we illustrate that antibiotic inputs have similar effects on soil communities and their function regardless of the type of microbial community which that system supports. However, antibiotic effects are more dramatic in systems where microbial diversity is low or has been reduced. This suggests that greater soil microbial diversity may help to reduce the negative impacts of antibiotics. Third, we find the global change factors (e.g., increasing soil temperature, shifts in precipitation patterns) interact with antibiotic additions leading to altered soil microbial communities and ecosystem processes. In fact, increasing temperature in the presence of antibiotics leads to less complex and efficient microbial communities.      This work directly contributed to the education and training of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students. This project and our findings were also integrated into undergraduate classes at the University of Idaho. Furthermore, a major component of this work was to develop middle school science curriculum. Approximately 90 middle school students have participated in this curriculum aimed at exploring soil communities and ecosystem carbon cycling. Through this curriculum students developed research questions and experiments to address those questions. Middle school students collected data using carbon dioxide sensors and have presented the results of their research via oral and poster presentations. The results from this project have been disseminated to both scientific and general audiences via talks, workshops, and the publication of scientific papers.

"Multivariate networks -- datasets that link together entities that are associated with multiple different variables -- are a critical data representation for a range of high-impact problems, from understanding how our bodies work to uncovering how social media influences society. These data representations are a rich and complex reflection of the multifaceted relationships that exist in the world. Reasoning about a problem using a multivariate network allows an analyst to ask questions beyond those about explicit connectivity alone: Do groups of social-media influencers have similar backgrounds or experiences? Do species that co-evolve live in similar climates? What patterns of cell-types support different types of brain functions? Questions like these require understanding patterns and trends about entities with respect to both their attributes and their connectivity, leading to inferences about relationships beyond the initial network structure. As data continues to become an increasingly important driver of scientific discovery, datasets of networks have also become increasingly complex. These networks capture information about relationships between entities as well as attributes of the entities and the connections. Tools used in practice today provide very limited support for reasoning about networks and are also limited in the how users can interact with them. This lack of support leaves analysts and scientists to piece together workflows using separate tools, and significant amounts of programming, especially in the data preparation step. This project aims fill this critical gap in the existing cyber-infrastructure ecosystem for reasoning about multivariate networks by developing MultiNet, a robust, flexible, secure, and sustainable open-source visual analysis system.  <br/><br/><br/>MultiNet aims to change the landscape of visual analysis capabilities for reasoning about and analyzing multivariate networks. The web-based tool, along with an underlying plug-in-based framework, will support three core capabilities: (1) interactive, task-driven visualization of both the connectivity and attributes of networks, (2) reshaping the underlying network structure to bring the network into a shape that is well suited to address analysis questions, and (3) leveraging provenance data to support reproducibility, communication, and integration in computational workflows. These capabilities will allow scientists to ask new classes of questions about network datasets, and lead to insights about a wide range of pressing topics. To meet this goal, we will ground the design of MultiNet in four deeply collaborative case studies with domain scientists in biology, neuroscience, sociology, and geology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.070,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,122506.00,122506,4900,Data Cyberinfrastructure,1835893,,Luke Harmon,,,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443051,lukeh@uidaho.edu,Luke,Harmon,vchandol@nsf.gov,Varun Chandola,7032922656,['01001819DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],09/06/2018,01/01/2019,12/31/2023,Collaborative Research: Framework: Software: HDR: Reproducible Visual Analysis of Multivariate Networks with MultiNet,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,"['Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences~2021~118~Patton, Austin H. and Harmon, Luke J. and del Rosario Castañeda, María and Frank, Hannah K. and Donihue, Colin M. and Herrel, Anthony and Losos, Jonathan B.~https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2024451118~~~~~When adaptive radiations collide: Different evolutionary trajectories between and within island and mainland lizard clades~~~10505648~10307901~OSTI~2022-04-11 00:03:03.753~', 'Molecular Ecology Resources~2024~24~Martinet, Kristen M. and Harmon, Luke J.~https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13938~~~~~Delimiting the rare, endangered and actively speciating~~~10505649~10505649~OSTI~2024-05-08 13:54:02.93~']","    Project Overview   This project developed MultiNet https://multinet.app, a general, robust, and sustainable software tool for reasoning about and analyzing multivariate networks and trees. The completed system allows researchers across multiple disciplines to upload their datasets, curate their data into a connected network structure, and view the resulting network using advanced, interactive visualizations. MultiNet is unique because it visualizes both the structure of the network and the attributes of the nodes and edges, unlike alternative systems that mostly visualize structure and possibly a single attribute.   MultiNet supports three core network-analysis capabilities: (1) reasoning about relationships using state-of-the-art techniques for interactively visualizing both the attributes and connectivity of large multivariate networks; (2) inferring new relationships using techniques for dynamic, user-driven reshaping of the underlying network structure based on its attributes; (3) reporting findings through provenance mechanisms that capture analysis sessions in support of reproducibility, dissemination, and collaboration.   The software design of the MultiNet framework uses a plug-in architecture model so the platform can be further extended with other general or domain-specific analysis interfaces in the future. A well-defined programming interface for accessing and updating the stored networks is designed into MultiNet to ease future development. In addition to the public MultiNet site, we designed the MultiNet system to use the Docker run-time container technology so individual researchers or institutions can instantiate their own version of MultiNet easily to use for private data. Outcomes:   The key technical outcomes of MultiNet are:   1. A platform for securely uploading and sharing network data and to develop network visualization plug-ins against.   2. The MultiLink Node-Link visualization; an advanced node-link view that implements sophisticated approaches to integrate node/edge attributes and network structure.      3. The MultiMatrix Adjacency Matrix visualization; an advanced adjacency matrix that supports grouping of nodes by attributes and rich attribute visualizations in a juxtaposed table.   4. An implementation of UpSet, a sophisticated and popular set visualization tool. Sets can also be thought of as hypergraphs, making it relevant for MultiNet. Upset visualizes set data in a novel way, as a matrix of set inclusion, instead of with traditional approaches like venn diagrams.      We evaluated MultiNet during the course of the project by partnering with experts in the disciplines of phylogenetics, neurology, social networking, and mineralogy. For each use case, our team developed innovative visualizations that streamlined the analysis of the domain-specific networks in each research case. In the following, we provide short descriptions of each of these projects.   Phylogenetic biology focuses on understanding and modeling the rate of evolutionary change and species formation in plant, animal, and microbial communities. Analytical modeling in phylogenetics often centers around binary or multi-way trees that represent patterns of common ancestry of species in communities, and can be used to understand the dynamics of change over time. The MultiNet system provides a novel way to view attributed phylogenetic trees.   With our retinal connectomics collaborator at Utah, we created a robust visual interface for multi-hop querying and exploring the connectivity of large, interconnected neural fabrics. We developed a domain-specific network querying algorithm to address specific scientific challenges faced by our collaborators. Additionally, we implemented an automated workflow that updates their data stored on the MultiNet application, reducing the time spent by our collaborators in the data upload and cleaning process.   In collaboration with computational social scientists at Duke, we developed visualizations to address temporal/dynamic network dataset that reflect the organization of social groups changing over time. The tasks included time varying visualizations and also visual representations of edge distributions of categorical and numerical attributes, thus expanding the visualization contribution beyond dynamic networks. We focused on matrix representations of edge distributions by attributes and representations of sociological constructs (e.g. triadic distributions). MultiNets provenance tracking was used to explore dynamic network changes.   For mineralogy researchers from Carnegie Science, we focused on unipartite and bipartite networks of minerals in selected groups on Earth and in martian meteorites. We customized the node appearance (size, color, shape) to represent various attributes of the mineralogical systems, including chemical composition, frequency of occurrence, and crystal structure. This work provided a holistic view of complex mineral systems and aided in scientific discovery. Broader Impacts   Our sustainable, modular software design enables others working on multivariate networks to use MultiNet as a platform upon which to build and add capabilities. We have already established various examples of how the MultiNet infrastructure has furthered other research efforts. The novel capabilities of MultiNet have led to new insights in collaboration application areas, with publications in retinal connectomics and evolutionary biology specifically crediting MultiNet.   Through their involvement in the MultiNet project, a diverse group of students has gained experience doing collaborative work. The project has supported several PhD students; one of which has already graduated. The project also supported several undergraduate researchers through an REU. Several students have since entered the STEM workforce.      Last Modified: 05/08/2024       Submitted by: LukeHarmon"
"This project will result in the creation of a software that will support research in the Earth's deep time history. The co-evolution of the geosphere and biosphere is one of the fundamental questions for the 21st century Earth science. The multi-disciplinary characteristics of the research questions on co-evolution are reflected in the various subjects of datasets that need to be integrated. In the past decades, many open data facilities have been built through the support from NSF and other sources. However, the shortage of efficient methods for accessing and synthesizing multi-source datasets hamper the data-intensive co-evolution research. Geologic time is an essential topic in the co-evolving geosphere and biosphere, and can be used as a common reference to connect various parameters among the data silos. This project will improve the machine readability and alignment of various global, local and regional geologic time standards and build a knowledge base of deep time and its service on the Web. All the deliverables will be well-documented and offered under open-access to promote a national cyberinfrastructure ecosystem. The planned tasks and activities will leverage the usage of existing data facilities, facilitate executable and reproducible workflows, generate best practices of cross-disciplinary data science, generate state-of-the-art materials to education programs, and engage the participation of female and underrepresented groups. Shared in the national cyberinfrastructure, the knowledge base built in the project will be able to support a broad range of research, education and outreach programs, which will benefit not only science and engineering but also the society at large.<br/><br/>The research question to be addressed is the heterogeneity of geologic time concepts that hamper the data synthesis among multiple data facilities. Accordingly, the objective of this project is to build a knowledge base of deep time to automate geoscience data access and integration in the open data environment, and to support data synthesis in executable workflows for data-intensive scientific discovery. The development approach will include both top-down and bottom-up tracks to leverage previous works on geologic time ontologies and address end user needs through use case analyses. With carefully designed activities and work plan, deliverables from this project will include a machine-readable knowledge base of aligned geologic time standards, services and packages for accessing and querying the knowledge base, and best practices of data synthesis in workflow platforms for studying the co-evolution. The developed knowledge base of deep time will provide powerful support to co-evolution researchers to tackle data heterogeneity issues. Robust services the knowledge base will be built to support automated data synthesis in workflow platforms to advance the co-evolution research. The source code and metadata of the knowledge base will be released on GitHub and registered on community repositories to enable reuse and adaptation. <br/><br/>This award by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Cross-Cutting Activities Program of the Division of Earth Sciences within the NSF Directorate for Geosciences, and the OAC Cyberinfrastructure for Emerging Science and Engineering Research (CESER) program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.070,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,596975.00,620375,4900,XC-Crosscutting Activities Pro,1835717,,Xiaogang Ma,875 Perimeter Dr.,Moscow,US,ID00,University of Idaho,ID,838443020,xgmachina@gmail.com,Xiaogang,Ma,sghafoor@nsf.gov,Sheikh Ghafoor,7032927116,"['01001819DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002021DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",09/06/2018,12/01/2018,11/30/2023,Elements: Software: HDR: A knowledge base of deep time to facilitate automated workflows in studying the co-evolution of the geosphere and biosphere,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,"['Geoscience Frontiers~2020~11~Ma, Chao and Li, Mingsong~https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2020.01.013~~~~~Astronomical time scale of the Turonian constrained by multiple paleoclimate proxies~~1345 to 1352~10199397~10199397~OSTI~2024-01-16 15:12:29.433~', 'Computers &amp; Geosciences~2022~161~Ma, Xiaogang~https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2022.105082~~~~~Knowledge graph construction and application in geosciences: A review~~105082~10328229~10328229~OSTI~2024-01-16 15:12:29.376~', 'National Science Review~2021~8~Wang, Chengshan and Hazen, Robert M and Cheng, Qiuming and Stephenson, Michael H and Zhou, Chenghu and Fox, Peter and Shen, Shu-zhong and Oberhänsli, Roland and Hou, Zengqian and Ma, Xiaogang and Feng, Zhiqiang and Fan, Junxuan and Ma, Chao and Hu, Xiumia~https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwab027~~~~~The Deep-Time Digital Earth program: data-driven discovery in geosciences~~~10299877~10299877~OSTI~2024-01-16 15:12:29.393~', 'Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs~2019~~Ma, Xiaogang~https://doi.org/10.1130/abs/2019AM-337787~~~~~DATA VISUALIZATION IN MINERAL EVOLUTION STUDIES~~~10199897~10199897~OSTI~2024-01-16 15:12:29.406~', 'Marine and Petroleum Geology~2020~118~Ma, Chao and Meyers, Stephen R. and Hinnov, Linda A. and Eldrett, James S. and Bergman, Steven C. and Minisini, Daniel~https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2020.104399~~~~~A method to decipher the time distribution in astronomically forced sedimentary couplets~~104399~10199398~10199398~OSTI~2024-01-16 15:12:29.423~', 'Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs~2021~~Ma, Xiaogang~https://doi.org/10.1130/abs/2021AM-370148~~~~~TEMPORAL TOPOLOGY FOR NOMINAL AND NUMERICAL ENTITIES THE DEEP-TIME KNOWLEDGE BASE~~~10308976~10308976~OSTI~2024-01-16 15:12:29.400~', 'Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs~2019~~Morrison, Shaunna M. and Eleish, Ahmed and Prabhu, Anirudh and Narkar, Shweta and Pan, Feifei and Huang, Fang and Fox, Peter and Zhang, Shuang and Howell, Samantha and Ma, Xiaogang and Ralph, Jolyon and Golden, Joshua J. and Downs, Robert T. and Hazen, Ro~https://doi.org/10.1130/abs/2019AM-341322~~~~~CHARACTERIZING CARBON MINERALOGY AND FORMATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS THROUGH DEEP TIME WITH ADVANCED ANALYTICS AND VISUALIZATION~~~10199896~10199896~OSTI~2024-01-16 15:12:29.413~', 'Computers &amp; Geosciences~2022~159~Sun, Ziheng and Sandoval, Laura and Crystal-Ornelas, Robert and Mousavi, S.

The proposed aim is to build a knowledge base of deep time to automate geoscience data access and integration in the open data environment, and to support executable workflows for the data-intensive co-evolution research. A total of four major activities were planned and implemented: 1) Developing a knowledge base of deep time; 2) Knowledge base curation, update and sharing; 3) Service of the built knowledge base and the interfaces for access and query; and 4) Developing best practices of multi-source data synthesis in automated workflows.       The technical deliverables of the project include a machine-readable knowledge base of aligned geologic time standards, services and packages for querying the knowledge base, and best practices of data synthesis in workflow platforms for studying the co-evolution. All the deliverables are made open access on the Web with detailed metadata. The project has leveraged the usage of existing data facilities, facilitated executable and reproducible workflows, generated best practices of cross-disciplinary data science, brought state-of-the-art materials to education program, and engaged the participation of female and underrepresented groups. Overall, the research has generated solid outcomes towards to the National Science Foundation (NSF)s goal on Harnessing the Data Revolution.      The project team members have produced very good record on publications and presentations. In total, 13 journal papers and two book chapters were published, 19 talks were given in conferences and workshops, and 11 seminars were given at different venues.Besides technical outputs and scientific publications, the team members have set up stable connection with the geoinformatics community to promote output reuse, such as Earth Science Information Partners, the International Association for Mathematical Geosciences, the American Geophysical Union, and the International Union of Geological Sciences. The links for demos and code, publication list, and other contents were all updated on project website deeptimekb.org. Moreover, the team members have used social media LinkedIn and Twitter to share activities and outputs of this project.      The project has created training and professional development activities for early-career researchers and students at different levels. Two postdoctoral fellows were trained in the project, one was successfully appointed as a faculty member in a university and the other joined the industry. Due to the pandemic, a PhD student was on board in the last year of the project, who worked on the data-driven use cases based on the deep-time knowledge base. During the work he found interest in Neuro-symbolic AI applications in geoscience and is now continuing the work with support from another project. With the NEU supplement, a total of five undergraduate students were trained as research interns in this project. Moreover, the three datathon activities (05/2019, 11/2022 and 05/2023) provided training activities to more than 30 early-career scientists and students on data science skills. The PI also adapted the project outputs in his data science classes for both undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Idaho.      Overall, this project is explicit for the broad applicability of the results and deliverables in the cyberinfrastructure ecosystem. Geologic time is a common element in many geoscience data facilities funded through NSF and other resources. The developed knowledge base of deep time is now an open service on the Web, which is accessible through workflow software platforms. The machine-readable code of the knowledge base is made open source to encourage adaption in various applications. Individual researcher can use them to access and connect datasets from multiple sources. Data facility providers can use them to improve the interoperability of their data. The developed use cases of workflow provide interactive examples about seamless data discovery, access and integration to support data-driven scientific discoveries. They are easy to understand and are used as best practices in training programs. All the deliverables are likely to have very broad interest and use in geoscience and other domains, and enable effective data science processes in a cross-disciplinary context.

"Non-technical Description<br/><br/>Plants and animals live in a fragile balance that can be upset by human land use decisions. This project aims to help landowners, state park planners, city planners, and Native American tribes in Idaho make informed decisions on land use that will minimize the effects on native wildlife. To do this, researchers from several colleges and universities across the state will create tools that will use data from a wide variety of sources including advanced genetics, ecological and geographical databases, and survey results from landowners and Native American tribes. These tools will provide options for land use that will encourage the most effective use of land while minimizing the impacts on native plant and animal species. Through this program, Idaho will engage the public, train the next generation of scientists, and develop exciting new tools that will provide new methods for scientifically informed land use decisions.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>This Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) Track-1 project from Idaho will study two keystone species (redband trout and sagebrush) in ecosystems of the American West. The project will use existing environmental legacy data to inform agent-based models (ABM) to predict adaptive capacity of these two species. The project team will determine the links between genomes and phenomes via experiments using temperature as the key variable to identify genomic responses of the adaptive capacity of these species and iteratively link them through the ABM to further inform our understanding of genetic capacity. Finally, the project participants will map species' genomes by environmental outcomes across additional impacts including biotic, abiotic, and various anthropogenic effects and local knowledge through methodologies originating from the social and economic sciences to inform the ABM model. The model will be used to predict the outcomes of various land use scenarios, and will be presented to stakeholder advisory groups who will discuss and make decisions based on the results from simulations. Decisions made by the stakeholder groups will further inform the model. It is expected that this iterative feedback model will be a transformative tool for land use decisions in Idaho and beyond. Additionally, strong workforce development plans will engage faculty, postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students of the three research universities in Idaho, as well as 2- and 4-year Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) in a Vertically Integrated Project approach that encourages all academic levels of the institution to work together. The inclusion of different types of higher educational institutions across Idaho will address and answer the state?s need for a well-trained workforce in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.083,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,20000000.00,20000000,4900,EPSCoR RII Track-1,1757324,,Andrew D Kliskey,"875 Perimeter Dr, MS 3010, Unive",Moscow,US,"ID""",University of idaho,ID,838443010,akliskey@uidaho.edu,Andrew,Kliskey,jswanson@nsf.gov,J.D.

Idaho scientists studied two key animal and plant groups: one aquatic (redband trout) and one terrestrial (sagebrush). These organisms are integral to ecosystems in the American West and are central to land-use management decisions that drive the economy of the region.   The project increased our understanding of genome-to-phenome responses, adaptive genome-by-environment interactions, and phenotypic plasticity in Idahos native species. Results from redband trout research demonstrate substantial plasticity to thermal stress in cold and cool montane populations while genetic adaptation to local thermal conditions may be more limited among the study populations. Sequencing of the sagebrush draft genome is complete and has been published on the National Center for Biotechnology Information and is being used to conduct population genetics analyses and use transcriptomics to identify mechanisms of drought resistance. The team also advanced bioinformatic pipelines to overcome challenges associated with assembly and annotation of a complex genome.   In concert with the advances made in understanding these mechanisms, the team completed development and publication of population distribution models and the simulation of adaptive capacity and population vulnerability using agent-based models. They advanced and published spatial maps of genotype-by-environment phenotypes in populations across complex social-ecological systems (SES) that are poised to inform management decisions across the Owyhee and Teton Valley regions in Idaho. This SES work has been advanced through the development and implementation of an innovative alternative scenarios methodology. Collectively the genomics, modeling, spatial mapping, and scenarios working groups have established a strong scaffolding for supporting integration and convergence across the program.   Intellectual Merit:   GEM3 is determining the mechanisms underlying population-level responses to environmental change and the feedback effects between SES and population responses. The approach entails determining how environmental processes, including land use changes, influence genome-to-phenome mechanisms and the adaptive capacity of populations. Bridging these gaps is advancing predictive models of population-level adaptive capacity under scenarios of future change.   Under the oversight of the Idaho EPSCoR Committee, the award advanced the State's Higher Education Research Strategic Research Plan, leveraging research and education strengths at University of Idaho, Boise State University, and Idaho State University in bioinformatics, complex modeling, ecology, fisheries science, genomics, geospatial science, remote sensing, and SES.   GEM3 included participation from approximately 88 research faculty in Idaho and helped prepare a highly-trained workforce. Over 150 undergraduates received paid research experiences with structured training. Over 100 graduate students and approximately 27 post-doctoral fellows also participated in the program. Also, as a sustainable contribution to our research capacity, eight new faculty hires were active GEM3 researchers. New hires enhanced the metrics for the number of publications in peer-reviewed journals and the number of proposals for extramural funding. Four of the new faculty hires were awarded six NSF grants as PI or Co-PI, one of which is a CAREER grant.   Broader Impacts:   The integrated Workforce Development and Broadening Participation program enhanced and increased the number, diversity and preparation of skilled scientists and engineers in GEM3 fields. Idahos three universities made further expansions to the rollout of the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIPs) strategy. The project built a robust on-ramp for students across Idahos research, predominantly undergraduate, and two-year colleges into research and training through development of lab modules in courses within our undergraduate curriculum and participation by diverse trainees in the Summer Authentic Research Experience (SARE). Lab modules, SARE and VIPs provided a range of training, mentoring and professional development support to both students and faculty that promoted transdisciplinary science, cross-institution training and continued to expand the next diverse generation of conservation scientists and leaders.   The partnerships with state, federal, tribal, and non-governmental agencies that support population models and tools have continued. This includes engagement with regional and national resource managers that are informing and supporting climate change and adaptive capacity assessments for fisheries in the state of Idaho and Pacific Northwest, and for sagebrush steppe landscapes in the state of Idaho and the Great Basin.

"Advances in sequencing DNA have led to an unprecedented increase in our understanding of microbial diversity, yet we lack a clear picture of how functional traits relate to organismal diversity, or to the gene content found in their genomes. Because of this, it is not clear how similar in DNA sequence two organisms need to be for us to call them the same thing. This has important consequences when making ecological inferences. The researchers have developed a novel way to rapidly determine which microbes grow well under different environmental conditions by following the frequency of unique ""barcodes"" that have been genetically inserted into a panel of 96 natural isolates of bacteria that naturally grow on plant leaves. The researchers will also be able to track how different strains of microbes assemble into communities, which will illuminate which ones can stably coexist. The work will ultimately shed light on the phylogenetic conservation of traits, association of those traits to changes in the genome, and how much these traits influence genetic exchange across microbes. Outreach to K-12 students will result in a greater appreciation by the public of microbial genetic and functional diversity.<br/><br/>Researchers will focus on the genus Methylobacterium, a collection of >50 named species well known for use of plant-derived methanol as one of their growth substrates. This team recently uncovered that Methylobacterium stimulates growth of soybeans when lanthanides are present; thus, there is opportunity to connect community diversity with an important ecosystem function. The team's novel barcoding system will accomplish two things not possible with traditional 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing: elimination of PCR bias, and the ability to track dozens of isolates simultaneously in any mixture, even if they have identical 16S rRNA. This proposal leverages data to develop a picture of the genus Methylobacterium at unprecedented depth and efficiency to examine the phylogenetic conservation of traits, associate traits to changes in genome content, and ask how much these traits influence genetic exchange across the genus. Ultimately, this can establish whether an abundant group of strains with identical 16S rRNA sequences represents a single cloud of successful genomes that are ecologically neutral with regard to each other, or a panel of ecologically diverse strains that have evolved distinct traits that permit coexistence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,1777713.00,1777713,4900,Dimensions of Biodiversity,1831838,,Christopher J Marx,875 Perimeter Drive,Moscow,US,ID01,University of Idaho,ID,838433051,cmarx@uidaho.edu,Christopher,Marx,kmclauch@nsf.gov,Kendra McLauchlan,7032922217,['01001819DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],08/10/2018,10/01/2018,09/30/2024,"Dimensions:  The roles of phylogeny, genome content, and functional performance traits in the evolution and assembly of a diverse Methylobacterium community",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Norma C Martinez-Gomez', 'Jack M Sullivan', 'James A Foster']",J,"['Genome Biology and Evolution~2022~14~Leducq, Jean-Baptiste and Sneddon, David and Santos, Malia and Condrain-Morel, Domitille and Bourret, Geneviève and Martinez-Gomez, N Cecilia and Lee, Jessica A and Foster, James A and Stolyar, Sergey and Shapiro, B Jesse and Kembel, Steven W and Sullivan~https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evac123~~~~~Comprehensive Phylogenomics of <i>Methylobacterium</i> Reveals Four Evolutionary Distinct Groups and Underappreciated Phyllosphere Diversity~~~10354709~10354709~OSTI~2022-09-07 21:03:16.353~', 'Frontiers in Microbiology~2022~13~Lee, Jessica A. and Stolyar, Sergey and Marx, Christopher J.~https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.849573~~~~~Aerobic Methoxydotrophy: Growth on Methoxylated Aromatic Compounds by Methylobacteriaceae~~~10354694~10354694~OSTI~2022-09-07 21:03:18.736~', 'Journal of Microbiology &amp; Biology Education~2022~23~Jones, Peyton A. and Frischer, David and Mueller, Shannon and Le, Thomas and Schwanes, Anya and Govindaraju, Alekhya and Shalvarjian, Katie and Leducq, Jean-Baptiste and Marx, Christopher J. and Martinez-Gomez, N.

"Non-Technical Abstract<br/>Soil microbial communities are vital to life on earth because they mediate many processes linked to human and environmental health. However, understanding the exact link between soil microbial communities and these processes is not always clear. Gaining this understanding is of particular importance in a changing world. One change likely to influence soil microbial communities, and the processes they regulate, are inputs of agricultural antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics has been a topic of recent public and scientific concern because of its potential to increase antibiotic resistance in environmental microbial communities and transfer resistance genes to pathogenic organisms. While this emphasis is important to public health it overlooks the impact, antibiotics may have on soil microbial communities. Through this fellowship the PI will examine the effect of antibiotics on soil microbial communities and the processes that they regulate. This understanding will improve understanding of the response of soil microbial communities to perturbations and may ultimately enable us to better understand the critical role played by these communities in the environment. Furthermore, this fellowship will build research capacity at the University of Idaho and improve the training of faculty, research personnel, and graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The overuse of antibiotics has been a topic of recent public and scientific concern because of its potential to increase antibiotic resistance in environmental microbial communities and transfer resistance genes to pathogenic organisms. While this emphasis is important for public health, it overlooks the broader impacts of antibiotic overuse on soil microbial communities. Given the potential that as much as 14 million kilograms of antibiotics could be entering soils annually through livestock manure, there could be widespread implications for soil microbial communities. This is especially concerning because soil microbial communities are central to the critical functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Research is beginning to indicate that antibiotic inputs can alter microbial-mediated biogeochemical cycles, but the specific changes in the microbial community that lead to these alterations are unclear. The research will clarify the specific changes in microbial community structure via a multi-omic approach. This approach includes the integration of multiple forms of -omic data (e.g., metagenomes, transcriptomes, and metabolomes) to give a clearer picture of the response of microbial community structure to antibiotics and the ensuing impact on ecosystem function. Training in multi-omic techniques will occur in collaboration with Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL). Through this fellowship, collaborations between PNNL and the University of Idaho will be strengthened allowing for the application of multi-omic techniques across multiple disciplines, from infectious disease to veterinary science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.083,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,215522.00,215522,4900,EPSCoR Research Infrastructure,1832888,,Michael S Strickland,902 Battelle Blvd,Richland,US,WA04,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,WA,993541793,mstrickland@uidaho.edu,Michael,Strickland,acharyas@nsf.gov,Subrata Acharya,7032922451,['01001819DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],08/20/2018,10/01/2018,09/30/2021,RII Track-4: A Multi-omic Approach Towards an Understanding of the Environmental Implications of Antibiotics on Soil Processes,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,S,"['Soil Biology and Biochemistry~2020~143~Lucas, Jane M. and McBride, Steven G. and Strickland, Michael S.~10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.107756~~~~~Trophic level mediates soil microbial community composition and function~~107756~10191843~10191843~OSTI~2020-09-14 17:01:52.846~', 'Soil biology biochemistry~2021~~Shawver, S. and Wepking, C. and Ishii, S. and Strickland, M.S. and Badgley, B.~https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108252~~~~~Application of manure from cattle administered antibiotics has sustained multi-year impacts on soil resistome and microbial community structure~N~~10300103~10300103~OSTI~2021-10-25 21:03:23.113~']"," Soil microbial communities are key mediators of ecosystem processes and are linked to human and environmental health. These communities are confronted by an array of factors likely to impact their function including climate change, the composition of the soil invertebrate community, and, often overlooked, inputs of agricultural antibiotics. These antibiotic inputs are not insignificant and have the capacity to influence microbial community composition, the prevalence of antibiotic resistance, and the ultimately the ecosystem processes that these microbial communities regulate. With this study, we investigated the development of antibiotic resistance and types of resistance genes, the impact of antibiotic resistance on ecosystem processes, and the interaction between antibiotics and other global change phenomena.  This project yielded comprehensive information on the impact agricultural antibiotics have on soil microbial communities, including information on how exposure to these antibiotics shapes microbial community composition, the type and prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes, and the ramifications of antibiotic exposure on ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycling. Specifically, we illustrate that in the short-term exposure to antibiotics shifts bacterial community composition and leads to a more fungal dominant community overall. Second, the composition of antibiotic resistance genes was largely unaffected by antibiotic inputs but was affected by the addition of manure. Finally, while resistance was not impacted by antibiotics, carbon and nitrogen cycling was, with antibiotics leading to a greater loss of carbon from soil ecosystems.  This work directly contributed to the education and training of a postdoctoral researcher and research faculty at the University of Idaho. Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher and faculty member received training in the use and application of multi-omic techniques. This project and our findings were also integrated into undergraduate classes at the University of Idaho to introduce students to key tools and concepts from microbiology, soil ecology, and ecosystem ecology.

"With the explosive growth of Big Data and Internet of Things, and the ever-growing demand for high-performance computing, mobility, security, and high-fidelity experiences, there is an increasing need for high-bandwidth and low-loss interconnect technologies that enable efficient data transfer across the chip. The optical fiber and its significant capacity for high-bandwidth data transfer are well-known in the telecommunications industry, and widely exploited in their long-distance network of interconnects. Scaling down optical interconnects to fit in nano-scale silicon chips would clearly be advantageous for achieving high-bandwidth data transfer on-chip -- however, a major hurdle is the dearth of accurate and efficient computable stochastic electromagnetic models for simulation of optical interconnect structures comprised of multiple tightly-coupled nano-scale silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wave-guides that carry information signals (i.e., TeraHertz electromagnetic waves) across on-chip transmitters and receivers. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop algorithms for a software tool to perform the design, analysis, and optimization of 3-dimensional (3-D) nano-scale optical interconnects based on SOI wave-guides exhibiting random surface roughness. The overall educational components of this project are to leverage the developed models and software to: (1) develop new graduate courses, (2) develop interactive learning objects and lab-based activities for undergraduate courses, and (3) stimulate undergraduate students' interest in science, and recruit and mentor diverse groups of students including women and minority groups. <br/><br/>The project team will develop the Optical Interconnect Designer Tool (OIDT) software, of which the input is comprised of: (1) the specified 3-D geometry representing the physical description of the multi-port optical interconnect system, (2) the random distribution for surface roughness of SOI wave-guide, and (3) the wave-guide material's electrical properties.

"Chlorinated organic solvents are the most common pollutants in groundwater in the U.S. Pollution of water supplies by these compounds represent a significant risk to public health, as several are known carcinogens that can result in exposure through drinking water. While engineers have developed treatment technology that uses the ability of microbes to consume these pollutants as food, the process can result in the production of harmful acids that eventually halts activity. The proposed research will shield these beneficial microbes in protective capsules called biobeads. These capsules will allow the beneficial microbes to continue to consume chlorinated organic solvents while producing clean water. These biobeads can be used with different microbes to address many environmental problems, with applications in many other fields including drug delivery, pharmaceuticals, food processing, and wastewater treatment. This project will augment undergraduate learning opportunities by incorporating the research into traditional undergraduate laboratory courses. If successful, this project will help protect the Nation's water security and ensure safe drinking water availability to the U.S. public. <br/><br/>Chlorinated organic solvents like tri- and per-chloroethene (TCE and PCE) are the most common pollutants in groundwater in the U.S. Pollution of water supplies by these compounds represent a significant risk to public health, as several are known carcinogens that can result in exposure through drinking water. While compounds like PCE can be destroyed through low cost, anaerobic reductive dichlorination, this process can lower pH, resulting in the accumulation of more soluble, volatile, and hazardous degradation products. Microorganisms resist pH change through a variety of internal means, including proton efflux and control of membrane permeability to restrict transport. Unfortunately, these pH control methods come at the cost of metabolic energy and optimal growth of the microorganism. The objective of this proposal is to address the current deficiency of pH control in bioremediation of chlorinated solvents by leveraging existing fundamental concepts from biological microencapsulation, hybrid organic-inorganic material science, and mass transport theory. The research will involve building a biobead with the goal of self-regulated pH control. The biobead environment will be designed to emulate and improve on pH and transport control mechanisms naturally employed by microorganisms. The ultimate goal of biobead encapsulation is to extend the range of active metabolism for the encapsulated organism in non-ideal external pH gradients. This biobead design will be accomplished through incorporation of bioinspired mechanisms into a layered capsule design via addition of buffer groups to control internal pH, adjustment of electrostatic structural charges to restrict charged species transport, and deployment of catalytic layers designed to efflux or react with protons driven by external photic stimuli. The research will be leveraged by the combinatorial power of hundreds of first-year undergraduate student scientists engaged in relevant, active learning to provide valuable data to achieve project objectives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,331379.00,331379,4900,EnvE-Environmental Engineering,1805358,,James Moberly,875 PERIMETER DR MS 1021,Moscow,US,ID01,University of Idaho,ID,838449803,jgmoberly@uidaho.edu,James,Moberly,krockne@nsf.gov,Karl Rockne,7032927293,['01001819DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],08/13/2018,09/01/2018,08/31/2023,Building Better Bio-Beads: Engineering Modulation of pH and Metabolite Diffusive Flux in Hydrogels,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Kristopher V Waynant'],,"['ACS ES&amp;T Engineering~2022~~Silsby, Carson J. and Counts, Jonathan R. and Christensen, Thomas A. and Roll, Mark F. and Waynant, Kristopher V. and Moberly, James G.~https://doi.org/10.1021/acsestengg.2c00107~~~~~Investigation of Hydronium Diffusion in Poly(vinyl alcohol) Hydrogels: A Critical First Step to Describe Acid Transport for Encapsulated Bioremediation~~~10358856~10358856~OSTI~2022-09-30 23:31:12.666~', 'Journal of Chemical Education~2022~~Silsby, Carson and McCormack, Roslyn and Roll, Mark F. and Moberly, James G. and Waynant, Kristopher V.~https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.2c00360~~~~~Implementing the Elements of Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) in a First-Year Undergraduate Chemistry Laboratory with Bioremediation Relevance~~~10358855~10358855~OSTI~2022-09-30 23:31:16.816~']","  Bioremediation is an effective, low-cost treatment strategy for trichloroethylene(TCE) destruction, however, a common challenge for this process is the build-up of acid which kills the organisms performing the remediation.

We evaluated several different polymer formulations for the speed at which acid, TCE, and its byproducts move through the polymers. This information helped us build a computer model to understand the number of microorganisms needed in each biobead and how much acid needed to be eliminated for the microorganisms to thrive. We also created a set of laboratory exercises to help undergraduate students become familiar with and active participants in this research by building their own polymers and measuring the speed of acid through them. We evaluated several different protective additives for their impact on changing the speed at which acid and TCE moved through the polymers including acid scavengers, known as polyoxometalates and buffering groups, and compounds that protect the microorganisms during the process of putting them in the polymer (cryoprotectants).

The full nature of this protective effect, however, is less well understood. A major barrier to understanding is the fact that almost nothing is known about the factors that influence the considerable variation in milk composition around the globe, or about the effects of this variation on infant health. This INSPIRE project represents the first comprehensive investigation of the global differences in human milk composition along with the various microbial, evolutionary, environmental, and sociocultural factors that might influence both milk composition and infant health. An international, interdisciplinary collaboration of physiologists, nutritional scientists, anthropologists, microbiologists, and mathematicians will collect biological data from breastfeeding women and their infants, in concert with extensive anthropologic and ecological data, in both developed (US, Spain, Sweden) and developing countries (Central African Republic, Gambia, Ghana, Peru, and Kenya). To test the possibility of a correlation between milk oligosaccharide composition, milk microbiota, and the gastrointestinal microbiome of infants, milk samples and infant fecal samples will be analyzed using state-of-the-art biochemical and genomic techniques.   This study will allow important cross-cultural comparisons of milk composition and infant feeding practices; it also will utilize sophisticated computational methods to integrate the extensive, diverse body of combined biological and anthropological data to elucidate the relationships among sociocultural factors, evolutionary history, environmental exposures, microbial constituents and milk composition. The researchers predict that what is considered ""normal"" milk composition in one population may not support optimal health in another.

Microbiomes in human milk and infant feces are related to each other but vary geographically.~~~~~~2019-12-29 14:26:36.866~']"," Milk composition has likely been under strong evolutionary pressure for tens of millions of years, and there is an established precedence to assume that normal, healthy milk is essentially the same for all humans. However, human subpopulations have been subject to significant shifts in the form of migration, social and cultural change, and alterations in agricultural practices. It is very likely that these shifts and alterations impact the composition of human milk and in fact exert evolutionary pressure in this regard. Thus, we predicted that nutrient composition of normal milk differs among human subpopulations. In addition, milk contains myriad non-nutritional components such as immune cells, hormones, human milk oligosaccharides (HMO), and microbiota that may respond to selective pressures.  In short, we conducted this study primarily because we doubted that humans share a common normal milk composition, including its bacterial community. Similarly, we questioned whether the infant's gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome is the same across populations and wondered if variation in it is related to that of the milk composition. Finally, we were interested in understanding better what environmental, nutritional, behavioral, and demographic factors were related to variation in milk composition and infant GI microbiome.  To test our hypotheses, we recruited 400+ healthy breastfeeding women and their infants living in 11 locations: Ghana, Kenya, rural Ethiopia, urban Ethiopia, rural Gambia, urban Gambia, Spain, Sweden, Peru, USA-California, and USA-Washington/Idaho. Unique to this study, all samples were collected using standardized methods; furthermore, samples were analyzed in a single laboratory. As such, we could be confident that differences detected across populations were real.  As anticipated, we found stark and sometimes surprising differences in a multitude of milk components including a host of immunologic factors, complex carbohydrates (referred to as human milk oligosaccharides), microbiomes, total protein, and even lactose which is generally considered to be one of the most stable constituents in milk. Our results suggest that some of these differences can be explained by variation in mothers' genetics and diet. In addition, differences in caregiving patterns and human milk oligosaccharides may modulate some of the variation in milk's microbiome; and household composition may impact an infant's GI microbiome.  Another important outcome of this study is the finding that, although the exact make-up of microbial compositions of milk and infant feces are different and vary across cohorts, there is a strong correlation between variation in milk and infant fecal microbiomes. Because it is unlikely that fecal microbiomes would impact mother's milk microbiomes, these data support the possibility that the microbes in milk are important colonizers of the recipient infant's GI tract.  To date, this INSPIRE project has resulted in 5 refereed journal articles, 1 book chapter, and 20+ abstracts and related presentations. Five graduate students have received substantial training related to the project, with an additional 10 undergraduate students also becoming acquainted to the research process through sample collection, data entry, and/or sample analysis. The research team has built important bridges across continents and disciplines via consistent virtual communications and a 3-day, hands-on workshop held in Sun Valley, Idaho during the fall of 2018.   To our knowledge, this project represents the most comprehensive and rigorous study of human milk composition variation around the world, and the only one to relate this variation with evolution, place, culture, and environment. Our finding that human milk oligosaccharides, microbiomes, and immune factors produced by healthy women vary around the world represents a substantial paradigm shift in terms of how we think about milk composition. Indeed, what is normal in this regard clearly depends on a complex of factors yet to be delineated.   We expect our findings to impact not only scientific thought related to infant nutrition, but also policies and regulations such as national/international nutrient recommendations for infants and guidelines for inclusion of nutrients and other substances in infant formulae and other infant foods.

"This project seeks to improve the paleoclimate record and the broader scientific understanding of past and future hydrologic variability in the South Atlantic Gulf Basin (AGB) and Southeastern (SE) United States by carrying out a three-year research program to investigate pre-instrumental streamflow and associated climate variability in this region. <br/><br/>The principle goals of the research program are to develop quantitative, multi-century, tree-ring reconstructions and to assess the risk of future streamflow in the SE and AGB.  The specific aims of this project are to 1) develop streamflow reconstructions for eight major, coastal, interstate rivers; 2) conduct inter-basin comparisons to identify spatial and temporal patterns of common and disparate streamflow variability across the region; 3) provide novel insights on how the dynamical modes of climate variability (e.g., El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Sub-tropical High, and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) force regional expressions of climate change, hydrological variability, extreme drought and pluvial events, and potential regime shifts over the past 500-1,000 years and 4) characterize the risk of future streamflow and extreme events in these watersheds.<br/><br/>This research will provide insight into not only the long-term variability of streamflow, but will also shed light on the associated physical, social, economic and ecological impacts this variability has on coastal watersheds in the AGB and SE US.  Improved understanding of streamflow variability will directly benefit the development of water policy in SE, by informing a variety of socially and economically relevant areas related to water withdrawals, streamflow forecasts, drought and flood mitigation.<br/><br/>Recent work on the Suwannee River (Florida) provides a successful example of how streamflow in the Southeast can be reconstructed over multiple centuries with high variance explained (R2=0.68) and robust validation statistics (RE, 0.71; CE, 0.81), in addition to providing novel insight into the controls of past hydroclimate to characterize and manage the risk of future streamflow in the AGB and SE.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include the potential for enhanced understanding of both the history of hydroclimate variability (especially extreme low flow events) and the role of regional and large-scale climate forcing mechanisms that drive streamflow variability.  This project seeks to provide information useful for applied risk management around hydrologic extremes in the South Atlantic Gulf Basin (AGB) and Southeastern (SE) United States region. Understanding the timing and magnitude of past events and having accurate future forecasting is crucial for public and private stakeholders to prepare for the future and increase resiliency.  In addition, by characterizing past, present and future streamflow and the risk of extreme events in the AGB and SE watersheds, this research will advance knowledge of how to protect and sustain riparian zones, coastal watersheds and surrounding lands now and into the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,54545.00,54545,4900,Paleoclimate,1805276,,Grant Harley,,,US,ID00,University of Idaho,ID,838443020,gharley@uidaho.edu,Grant,Harley,dverardo@nsf.gov,David Verardo,7032924695,['01001819DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/31/2018,08/01/2018,07/31/2022,Collaborative Research: P2C2--Paleo-Perspectives of Streamflow Variability for Southeastern Interstate Rivers,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,"['Forests~2020~11~Therrell, Matthew D. and Elliott, Emily A. and Meko, Matthew D. and Bregy, Joshua C. and Tucker, Clay S. and Harley, Grant L. and Maxwell, Justin T. and Tootle, Glenn A.~https://doi.org/10.3390/f11101100~~~~~Streamflow Variability Indicated by False Rings in Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum (L.)

Because tree growth is sensitive to soil moisture changes in a similar way as streamflow, we were able to use tree rings to estimate past streamflow, for several centuries in the past. We found that when expanding these streamflow records, we were able to detect long-term changes in streamflow behavior. In South Carolina, we found that high levels of streamflow have become more common and has resulted in more flooding than has been experienced in almost 1000 years. This increase in flooding is the result of atmospheric circulation patterns, steering more moisture into the Atlantic Southeast of the US.   In northwestern Florida, we used 28 trees from two sites located adjacent to the Choctawhatchee River to develop a false ring record extending from 1881 to 2014. Twenty false ring events were recorded during the available instrumental era (1931?2014). All 20 of the false-ring events recorded during the instrumental period occurred during years in which greatly increased streamflow occurred late in the growing season. Many of these wet events appear to be the result of rainfall resulting from landfalling tropical cyclones. We also found that the intra-annual position of false rings within growth rings reflects streamflow variability and combining the false-ring record with tree ring width chronologies improves the estimation of overall summer streamflow by 14%.  For heavily litigated, interstate rivers of the Southeast, we used streamflow data from five gages near the Alabama-Florida border and centuries-long tree-ring chronologies to create and analyze seasonal flow reconstructions. The long-term streamflow variability was analyzed for the Choctawhatchee, Conecuh, Escambia, and Perdido Rivers, and the recent (2000s) drought was identified as being the most severe in the instrumental record. The 2000s drought was also identified as being one of the most severe droughts throughout the entire reconstructed paleo-record developed for all five rivers.  We were able to examine different aspects of streamflow across the Southeast to determine what tree growth is responding to. Stormflow represents the increase in streamflow from storms. Baseflow represent fluctuations in streamflow from changes in groundwater. We found that streamflow in South Carolina was most sensitive to baseflow. This allows streamflow reconstruction to better connect with models that water managers examine and use in their planning for flooding and drought. In a study of false ring formation in relation to flow variability, we found that false-ring events recorded during the instrumental period occurred during years in which greatly increased streamflow occurred late in the growing season. Many of these wet events appeared to be the result of rainfall resulting from landfalling tropical cyclones. We also found that the intra-annual position of false rings within growth rings reflects streamflow variability and combining the false-ring record with tree-ring width chronologies statistically improved the estimation of overall summer streamflow. In the case of the Alabama-Florida interstate rivers, knowledge of previous years? droughts and pluvial events is critical when making water policy decisions. With the combined stressors of population growth, interstate water wars, and climate change, it is imperative for Florida water managers and planners to have a full understanding of hydrologic parameters in the region. The 2000s drought was also identified as being one of the most severe droughts throughout the entire reconstructed paleo-record developed for all five rivers, and this information is vital for the consideration of present and future conditions within the systems. Further, this project provided several opportunities for education. A total of three graduate students and one undergraduate student from the University of Idaho were able to learn the techniques of sampling trees, preparation of samples, and the statistical analyses associated with reconstructing streamflow using tree rings. Further, all these students assisted in the publication of the results from this funding and are coauthors on majority of the publications that came from this project.

"No virus can infect all host species; therefore virus host range is limited. Sometimes, a change in even one cellular component may turn a host to a resistant host, or a resistant host into a host for the virus. This project will study brewer's/baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to understand how the presence of a virus can select for host-specific changes that alter the replication of viruses, and how viruses can adapt to infect new hosts. The familiarity and public interest in brewer's/baker's yeast will facilitate the outreach to the public, and experimental evolution curriculum will be developed for high schools using yeasts.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to identify adaptive changes that occur within S. cerevisiae in response to viral parasitism and the evolutionary response of viruses to changing host environments. Persistence of viruses within yeasts drives the evolution of both host and virus as cellular machinery adapts to abrogate virus replication and viruses evolve to ensure their persistence.  Saccharomyces yeasts that are infected with different types of viruses will be evolved in the laboratory over hundreds of generations to observe the evolutionary response to viral parasitism in real-time. Next generation sequencing techniques will be used to identify adaptive genetic changes in either the host or virus that are important for persistent viral replication and/or antiviral defense. The genetic tools available for S. cerevisiae will allow the manipulation of both host and virus to identify the consequences of adaptive changes on virus persistence. This work will build on previous observations that have identified species-specific changes in host genes that can affect the replication of viruses within Saccharomyces yeasts. The expected outcomes of this research are a better understanding of the dynamic interplay between virus and host over multiple generations and the identification of genes and cellular processes that govern viral persistence within S. cerevisiae. Due to the common ancestry and conserved cellular mechanisms of eukaryotic organisms, these findings could potentially be applicable to virus-host interactions of higher eukaryotes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,478053.00,478053,4900,Genetic Mechanisms,1818368,,Paul A Rowley,,,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443051,prowley@uidaho.edu,Paul,Rowley,cweil@nsf.gov,Clifford Weil,7032924668,"['01001819DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002021DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",07/30/2018,08/01/2018,07/31/2023,Collaborative Research: Eukaryotic virus-host interaction and evolution in Saccharomyces yeasts,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,A,"['Viruses~2022~14~Lee, Mark D. and Creagh, Jack W. and Fredericks, Lance R. and Crabtree, Angela M. and Patel, Jagdish Suresh and Rowley, Paul A.~https://doi.org/10.3390/v14030594~~~~~The Characterization of a Novel Virus Discovered in the Yeast Pichia membranifaciens~~594~10345779~10345779~OSTI~2022-08-02 13:03:38.390~', 'Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy~2021~65~Fredericks, Lance R. and Lee, Mark D. and Eckert, Hannah R. and Li, Shunji and Shipley, Mason A. and Roslund, Cooper R. and Boikov, Dina A. and Kizer, Emily A. and Sobel, Jack D. and Rowley, Paul A.~https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.02450-20~~~~~Vaginal Isolates of Candida glabrata Are Uniquely Susceptible to Ionophoric Killer Toxins Produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae~~~10345778~10345778~OSTI~2022-08-02 13:03:52.336~', 'FEMS Yeast Research~2023~23~Crabtree, Angela M. and Taggart, Nathan T. and Lee, Mark D. and Boyer, Josie M. and Rowley, Paul A.~https://doi.org/10.1093/femsyr/foad046~~~~~The prevalence of killer yeasts and double-stranded RNAs in the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>~~~10475207~10475317~OSTI~2023-12-22 15:05:50.936~', 'PLOS Genetics~2021~17~Fredericks, Lance R. and Lee, Mark D. and Crabtree, Angela M. and Boyer, Josephine M. and Kizer, Emily A. and Taggart, Nathan T. and Roslund, Cooper R. and Hunter, Samuel S. and Kennedy, Courtney B. and Willmore, Cody G. and Tebbe, Nova M. and Harris, Jad~https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009341~~~~~The Species-Specific Acquisition and Diversification of a K1-like Family of Killer Toxins in Budding Yeasts of the Saccharomycotina~~e1009341~10251116~10251116~OSTI~2021-06-19 21:03:42.366~', 'Viruses~2019~11~Crabtree, Angela and Kizer, Emily and Hunter, Samuel and Van Leuven, James and New, Daniel and Fagnan, Matthew and Rowley, Paul~10.3390/v11010070~~~~~A Rapid Method for Sequencing Double-Stranded RNAs Purified from Yeasts and the Identification of a Potent K1 Killer Toxin Isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae~~70~10092919~10092919~OSTI~2019-05-02 13:01:55.490~', 'PLOS Pathogens~2023~19~Taggart, Nathan T. and Crabtree, Angela M. and Creagh, Jack W. and Bizarria, Rodolfo and Li, Shunji and de la Higuera, Ignacio and Barnes, Jonathan E. and Shipley, Mason A. and Boyer, Josephine M. and Stedman, Kenneth M. and Ytreberg, F.

Surprisingly, we found that these yeasts and their close relatives produce various toxins that can hinder the growth of different types of fungi. More than half of them actually produce toxins. We've harnessed this group of toxin-producing yeasts to prevent unwanted contamination in craft brewing, which could save the industry millions of dollars in lost product annually. Additionally, these yeast toxins turned out to be effective against Candida glabrata, a yeast linked to recurring vaginal infections and serious diseases in humans. Even though Candida glabrata is vulnerable to yeast toxins, it can quickly develop resistance in the lab. This resistance revealed new pathways that interact with toxins, suggesting that the yeast cells modify their surfaces to protect themselves from intoxication. We also discovered a connection between yeast toxin production and the presence of viruses and virus-like elements. This led us to uncover some new viruses using specialized techniques for sequencing virus genomes. Our findings highlight the potential of yeast toxins in combating yeast species that impact human health and the brewing industry. As part of the broader impacts of the research, we involved more than 40 undergraduate students in meaningful research projects at the University of Idaho. Additionally, we engaged in educational activities with middle and high school students, where they participated in yeast propagation and evolution experiments. The efforts of these students even led to the discovery of potential new pathways to drug resistance in fungi. Overall, this project discovered many new viruses and toxins that are produced by yeasts with potential future industrial and medical applications. These toxins will also be important for the future investigation of fundamental mechanisms of the cell.        Last Modified: 11/22/2023       Submitted by: PaulARowley"
"One goal of evolutionary ecology is to understand the processes that lead to species becoming better adapted to their local environment.  Studies of local adaptation have historically focused on geographically separated populations, where adaptive differences are maintained by limited dispersal of individuals between populations. Growing evidence, however, suggests that adaptive evolution can occur over small spatial distances. How this fine scale, adaptation arises and is maintained remains unresolved, despite applications for human health, agriculture, and biodiversity. On Santa Cruz Island, the Island Scrub Jay has two morphologies. Birds in pine habitat have long and thin beaks where as those in oak habitats have short and deep beaks. These differences are known to facilitate feeding on pine cones versus acorns, but how such adaptive genetic differences are maintained over very small geographic distances is unknown. The researchers will collect data on the genomes of individuals from both types of habitats to test if the same set of genes are differentiated between pine and oak populations, and how other regions of the genome change spatially across the island. These measurements will be coupled with telemetry studies that track how birds move and use oak and pine habitats. In addition, vocal experiments will test if males prefer females that originate within their habitat. The data obtained from this work will then be used to develop general models that can inform the conditions under with adaptive differences in can occur. Such models would be of interest to conservation managers that manage this and other unique or rare species. Additionally, the project will produce a learning module for high school classroom use, and will provide research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>Cases of microgeographic adaptation challenge classical evolutionary theory that posits adaptive divergence should be constrained by gene flow, leading to a reassessment of the spatial scale at which evolutionary processes occur. The research team has recently discovered replicated, adaptive divergence in jay bill shape in adjacent oak and pine habitats, despite gene flow between these adjacent habitats. This pattern occurs across habitats separated by less than one kilometer. The researchers will test alternative hypotheses about how divergent selection, dispersal, and non-random mating shape adaptive divergence in bill morphology. In Aim 1, they develop population genetic models that test the interacting effects of selection, gene flow, assortative mating, and genetic architecture at different spatial scales. In Aim 2, they will test for divergent selection by measuring selection gradients, examining patterns of genomic divergence, and by identifying candidate genes associated with variation in bill morphology. In Aim 3, they will use a combination of population genomics, telemetry, and transplant experiments to test for population genomic structure and if dispersal is non-random In Aim 4, they will test if divergence in bill morphology is correlated with vocalizations and facilitates assortative mating. Collectively, the proposed work takes an integrative approach in a tractable study system. This research has broad implications for understanding both the spatial scale at which adaptive divergence occurs, and the conditions that allow individuals within a single population to diverge across heterogeneous habitats.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,203667.00,203667,4900,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,1754816,,Paul A Hohenlohe,,,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443051,hohenlohe@uidaho.edu,Paul,Hohenlohe,sscheine@nsf.gov,Samuel Scheiner,7032927175,['01001819DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/06/2018,08/01/2018,07/31/2023,Collaborative Research: Testing Mechanisms of Microgeographic Adaptation,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,A,"['Evolution~2021~76~Clancey, Erin and Johnson, Timothy R. and Harmon, Luke J. and Hohenlohe, Paul A.~https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.14397~~~~~Estimation of the strength of mate preference from mated pairs observed in the wild~~p. 29-41~10351956~10362848~OSTI~2023-09-19 17:04:44.23~', 'The American Naturalist~2023~~Clancey, Erin and MacPherson, Ailene and Cheek, Rebecca G and Mouton, James C and Sillett, T Scott and Ghalambor, Cameron K and Funk, W Chris and Hohenlohe, Paul A~https://doi.org/10.1086/727723~~~~~Unraveling Adaptive Evolutionary Divergence at Microgeographic Scales~~~10463578~10463578~OSTI~2023-09-18 18:21:57.403~', 'Molecular Ecology~2021~30~Hohenlohe, Paul A. and Funk, W.

We combined field work, population genomics, and mathematical modeling in an integrated framework to understand how natural populations can evolve phenotypic differences even at microgeographic scales.  As a model system for microgeographic divergence, we focused on the island scrub jay, the bird species with the smallest range of any in North America, which nonetheless exhibits divergence in bill size and shape between oak and pine habitats.  The UI portion of this team led the modeling efforts (Aim 1) and collaborated on the genomics components (Aims 2 and 3).     Intellectual merit: Our modeling work produced several important results for understanding microgeographic divergence.  First, we developed a novel statistical method for estimating the strength of mate choice in species, like scrub jays, in which individuals choose mates on the basis of phenotypic traits.  This method provided a key bridge between empirical and modeling components in this project, and also provides a more powerful tool for other researchers studying assortative mating in natural populations.  Second, we developed a set of both analytical and simulation models to test hypotheses about microgeographic divergence based on our empirical data from island scrub jays.  We found that our empirical estimates of factors like dispersal and natural selection are sufficient to explain the observed divergence in island scrub jays.  We also found that a combination of natural selection and phenotype-dependent dispersal is generally able to produce divergence at microgeographic scales, but that assortative mating is unlikely to play an important role.  These modeling results illuminate important evolutionary factors in island scrub jays, and they also suggest that microgeographic divergence may be widespread in natural populations of other species.     Broader impacts: This project provided partial support and training in genomics and mathematical modeling for a M.S. student, a Ph.D. student, and a postdoctoral researcher.  It supported teaching in a conservation genomics workshop for students, researchers and professionals.  Additionally, tools developed during the modeling components of this project have been made available to the scientific community: an R package (called matepref) for estimating the strength of mate choice in natural populations, and computer code to conduct simulation modeling of microgeographic divergence that other researchers can adapt to other species or populations.

"This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase student motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM). Voices to Hear (V2H) will use the oral tradition of storytelling to empower Native American students (middle school, high school and college) to engage in environmental decision-making and scientific communication, while building a stronger sense of their ethnic identity. The Coeur d'Alene Tribe (CdAT), University of Idaho, and University of New Hampshire research alliance will recruit and work with middle school, high school, and undergraduate students from the CdAT Reservation in Idaho and other Tribal youth who attend University of Idaho, to develop high-quality audio documentaries focused on environmental decision-making processes. The production of a three- or five-minute high- quality audio documentary/podcast is a multilayered, labor-intensive process that emphasizes scientific inquiry, patience, and perseverance, ultimately requiring observation, data collection, analysis, and building a summary or conclusion.  While podcasts resonate strongly with the oral storytelling traditions of native American youth, they also provide a mechanism for conducting scientific inquiry. The project focuses on students learning about how to merge different knowledge systems (Western- mainstream/dominant science perspective, and Indigenous traditional knowledge) in order to become effective environmental decision-makers in the future. By investigating how community members resolve local environmental problems, students will be mentored by traditional and professional experts, and learn to utilize both STEM and cultural perspectives to solve environmental issues.  The project will develop and implement a unique, vertically integrated mentoring model where Native undergraduate students will be trained to mentor high school and middle school students, thereby helping middle school and high school students learn about pathways to college and other careers. <br/><br/>The V2H project will examine how people from Native American communities negotiate their Indigenous knowledge sources with Western science to make decisions in their everyday lives. The project grounds itself in research on how student's ethnic identity impacts their science learning and also decision-making capacity in their everyday life. Project research will employ a mixed-methods design. The project will address several research questions: (1) What complex systems thinking attributes do students demonstrate? (2) How do students merge or negotiate different knowledge systems (Indigenous and Western)? (3) How do the students ethnic identity change through both audio documentary making and mentoring? (4) What aspects of complex thinking and integrating knowledge systems improve students attitudes toward traditional and non-traditional STEM topics? Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected and parallel data analysis will be implemented through the life of the project.  In order to understand what complex thinking attributes students demonstrate, the project will employ a pre- and post- modeling activity, using Mental Modeler, software that allows individuals to define components of a system and show the interconnectedness between the components of that system.

The V2H program engages Tribal youth (middle school, high school, and undergraduate) to develop and share stories via podcasts to facilitate an understanding of how their Tribe addresses significant environmental issues, both culturally and scientifically. Over three summers, V2H youth participated in three to six-week learning experiences delivered face-to-face or virtually (in the case of the COVID pandemic). The project's key outcome is producing and presenting high-quality audio documentaries: https://www.cdatribe-nsn.gov/education/voices-to-hear/ that emphasizes processes of scientific inquiry, quantitative and qualitative data collection, and analysis to provide a culturally nuanced understanding of the issues.     Program evaluation indicates participants displayed an increased understanding of STEM careers within the Tribe’s Department of Natural Resources and other environmental protection departments. Additionally, participants expressed great interest in learning from several additional Tribal departments and divisions (i.e., cultural restoration, cultural tourism). Participant interviews indicated an emerging understanding of the meaning and importance of the above Tribal Core Values related to their identity and relationship to their Tribe.     Other significant outcomes are the cross-generational communication and dialogue among program youth, Tribal leaders, community members, and professional scientists who work for the Tribe. V2H youth and their mentors interacted with Tribal leaders and professionals to learn about and gather information to create program podcasts (see about). All program podcasts were distributed to the Tribal community through public and Tribal websites, social media, and other youth-community events.     The most significant outcome of the V2H project is the continuation and sustainability of the program by the Coeur d'Alene Tribe.

"The theory of plate tectonics states that the surface of the Earth is made up of numerous moving plates. The interior regions of these plates are believed to be rigid and strong, while boundaries in the ocean where the plates spread apart, mid-ocean ridges, are thin, hot, and weak. In contrast to the standard expectations of plate tectonic theory, observations find that sections of mid-ocean ridges often shift, or jump, from weak boundaries to strong plate interiors. As a result, jumps of mid-ocean ridges can change the size and shape of the tectonic plates and even create micro-continents (small slivers of continental material) when they jump into continental regions. Mid-ocean ridge jumps are believed to result after some process weakens a nearby plate interior.  However, scientists do not know the reasons or driving forces behind this weakening. Previous studies examined mid-ocean ridge jumps in a 2D geometry, but could not address several key processes that would control their formation, leaving a gap in our understanding of plate tectonics.  In this study, innovative laboratory and state-of-the-art 3D numerical simulations will be used to isolate the processes that lead to mid-ocean ridge jumps. Understanding these processes will improve understanding of the thermal evolution of the planet and the locations of potential mineral resources associated with past hydrothermal activity. The educational component of this CAREER award has two primary goals: 1) to motivate young students (~10-18 years old) to pursue STEM-based inquiry through interactive, marine geology-based video games that are engaging, entertaining, and provide easily accessible opportunities for in-depth exploration of marine geology topics, and 2) to involve several interdisciplinary groups of undergraduate students in a hands-on, engaging experience where they learn STEM skills and explore marine geologic data.<br/><br/><br/>Observations of numerous relic spreading centers and micro-continents formed by sudden relocations or jumps of ridge axes indicate that mid-ocean ridge jumps regularly shift to new, off-axis locations. This project's primary research goal is to quantify the processes that govern ridge jumps and thereby test the hypothesis that there are predictable length- and time-scales for ridge jump formation. This goal is split into three objectives that aim to quantify: 1) the role of magmatic accretion in propagation of nascent rifts adjacent to established ridges and consequent formation of transform faults or overlapping spreading centers; 2) mantle plume-induced ridge jumps in oceanic lithosphere; and 3) micro-continent formation by jumps into continental lithosphere. These objectives will be addressed with 3D numerical simulations and innovative laboratory experiments using colloidal fluids. To establish testable predictions from these models and experiments, results will be used to derive functional relationships between length- and time-scales of ridge jumps and observable quantities such as spreading rate, ridge migration rate, seafloor age, and melt flux. These relationships will be evaluated through comparison to a new database of jump statistics including jump distance, final segment length, transform fault or overlapping spreading center formation rate and location, and the time between repeat jumps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,599643.00,599643,4900,Marine Geology and Geophysics,1753354,,Eric L Mittelstaedt,875 Perimeter Dr. MS3022,Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443022,emittelstaedt@uidaho.edu,Eric,Mittelstaedt,gchriste@nsf.gov,Gail Christeson,7032922952,"['01001819DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001920DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002021DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002223DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",04/23/2018,05/01/2018,04/30/2025,"CAREER: Moving into the 3rd Dimension: Quantifying the influence of Magmatism, Tectonics, Hydrothermal Cooling, and Hotspots on the Dynamic Evolution of Divergent Plate Boundaries",Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,L,,
"This REU Site award to the University of Idaho, located in Moscow, ID, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2018 - 2020. Participants conduct hands-on, independent research in the areas of molecular and organismal evolution under the guidance of faculty mentors in the Department of Biological Sciences. Research interests among faculty mentors range from molecular processes of evolutionary change to the adaptation of organisms on the landscape level. The summer program is enriched by weekly research seminars, a series of professional development workshops, training in ethical and responsible conduct of research, and a variety of social activities. The program concludes with a student research symposium. Student participants receive room-and-board, round trip travel to the University of Idaho, and a stipend. Students are recruited nationally and submit application materials through an online application process. Students are selected based on their academic record, statement, letters of recommendation, potential to benefit from the experience, interview with prospective mentors, and program goals. Selection is accomplished by the Principal and Co-Principal Investigators in consultation with faculty mentors. Special emphasis will be placed on the recruitment of students from groups underrepresented in the sciences and from institutions without extensive access to research opportunities. Information about the program is assessed through follow-up surveys, including use of an REU common assessment tool. <br/><br/>It is anticipated that a total of 30 students primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. <br/><br/>A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program.

Projects were structured around 10-week summer research programs. Program elements were designed to positively influence undergraduates toward postgraduate education and careers in science. From 2018 to 2021, a total of 30 students were recruited from around the country to participate in this program. Each student designed and conducted their own independent research project under the guidance of a faculty mentor. Some student projects addressed questions that combined field and laboratory work while others were strictly laboratory-based.  In addition to student research, this program included weekly research seminars, a series of career development workshops, and a variety of organized social activities designed to facilitate student learning and development. Each 10-week program concluded with a half-day student research symposium at the University of Idaho during which students presented the results of their summer work to other undergraduate researchers, graduate students, faculty, and members of the general public. Students presented their results in both oral and poster format.  Recruitment strategies were designed to attract a diverse group of students from a wide range of institutions. Of the total number of students who participated in this program, 53.3% were from racial or ethnic minority groups, 73.3% were women, and 70% were from institutions other than the University of Idaho. 40% of the students were from institutions with limited opportunities for research and 36.6% were first generation college students. Finally, our 30 REU students represented 21 different home institutions located in 15 different states, Puerto Rico, and Guam.  An important outcome of this program was its direct contribution to the development of human resources. By involving undergraduate students in hands-on, faculty-mentored research, this program integrated research activities with student education in science. Through direct participation in research, students were trained in how to approach questions using the scientific method. Critical thinking skills were reinforced throughout the program. Furthermore, this program included a diverse mix of students, including members of underrepresented minority groups, first-generation college students, and students from institutions where access to research opportunities is limited. Program elements were designed to positively influence students toward post-graduate education and careers in the sciences. Consequently, this program yielded a diverse set of students who possess the appropriate skills and preparation to enter and excel in postgraduate education in science.

"The Arctic is warming faster than any other area of the world and its boreal forests have experienced dramatic increases in the size and frequency of fires. The fast pace of these changes has prompted concern because boreal forests make up about a third of all forests worldwide, contain almost half of the world's stored carbon, and have been historically stable with black spruce dominating this landscape for the past 6,000 years. Warming of 2-8 °C is projected by the end of the century and the emergence of a new fire regime threatens to disrupt this forest ecosystem. For example, in some regions of interior Alaska, the fire return interval has decreased to 10-50 years, causing shifts from black spruce to deciduous trees and grasses. Changes in the climate and fire regime are also expected to affect global carbon cycling since fires and thawing of frozen soils (permafrost) may release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. This research will incorporate field studies and computer simulations to determine how fire frequency and climate change affect shifts between vegetation types (e.g. switch from conifer to grasses) and long term carbon storage in this vast and under-studied region. The study will train graduate students and involve Native American high school students from the Rural Alaska Honors Institute (RAHI) in field work. The investigators will collaborate with Your World Rocks (YWR), a nonprofit organization of female scientists and engineers dedicated to promoting science education in elementary schools. They will develop hands-on activities focusing on climate change, forests, and fire and conduct free hands-on activities in elementary schools in the greater Portland/Vancouver metro area, with a particular focus on underserved Title 1 schools. <br/><br/>The fast pace of climate warming and an increase in fire frequency over the past few decades in northern latitudes has raised concerns about major shifts in vegetation and the long-term ability of ecosystems to capture and store carbon. Boreal forest ecosystems account for about 33% of all forests worldwide and contain about 45% of the world's carbon stocks, with the majority (~85%) stored belowground. For the past 6,000 years, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) has been the dominant species over a large proportion of this landscape, exhibiting substantial resilience to changes in climate. However, unprecedented warming (causing earlier snowmelt, permafrost thawing, and longer growing seasons) and the emergence of a new fire regime over the past 60 years threatens to disrupt the existing dominance by black spruce and release globally significant amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. The goal of this research is to quantify the potential for large-scale changes in carbon (C) sink strength, C stocks, and vegetation in boreal forests due to climate change and repeated wildfires by integrating mechanistic field and lab work with dynamic, spatially explicit landscape modeling. Working in central Alaska, the investigators will: 1) determine how fire frequency and climate change affect successional trajectories and above- and belowground C cycling, and 2) assess how the mechanisms that cause tipping points between vegetation types (i.e. conifer, hardwood, graminoid) and C sequestration (i.e. sink, source) vary spatially and temporally. To achieve these objectives, the investiagors will empirically measure above- and belowground C stocks, productivity, heterotrophic respiration, soil temperature and moisture content, and active layer thickness in the field and quantify C mineralization using laboratory soil incubations. They will also develop and validate a physically based permafrost/hydrology module for a widely-used, high resolution landscape simulation model (LANDIS-II) to forecast long-term dynamics of species composition and C source/sink status given projected changes in climate (including thawing permafrost) and fire. The work will improve our understanding of how C cycling and species composition in boreal forests will respond to climate change and disturbances at the fine spatial scales critical to accurately project the future of the boreal forest.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,203592.00,203592,4900,ANS-Arctic Natural Sciences,1737413,,Timothy E Link,975 W. 6th Street,Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838441133,tlink@uidaho.edu,Timothy,Link,mstiegli@nsf.gov,Marc Stieglitz,7032924354,['0100XXXXDB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/25/2017,01/01/2018,12/31/2021,Collaborative Research: Regional  impacts of increasing fire frequency on carbon dynamics and  species composition in the boreal forest,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,E,"['Scientific Reports~2022~12~Buma, B. and Hayes, K. and Weiss, S. and Lucash, M.~https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-08912-8~~~~~Short-interval fires increasing in the Alaskan boreal forest as fire self-regulation decays across forest types~~~10324266~10364233~OSTI~2024-09-20 20:00:55.360~']","   The northern boreal forest typically burns in catastrophic wildfires that occur at ~100-200 year intervals. In the period between burns, the regrowing vegetation contributes to a buildup of carbon in the surface and mineral soils, removing the carbon as carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. The accumulated carbon at the soil surface, called the organic layer, helps to insulate the soil and contributes to the formation of permafrost, or ground that is frozen for two or more years in a row. The permafrost further helps to capture carbon in the soil, and over many burn cycles across millennia, tremendous amounts of carbon have become associated with permafrost across northern regions which helps to maintain this conifer-dominated ecosystem. Because of ongoing climate change, some models predict that wildfires will occur more frequently in the boreal forest. If this were to occur, the normal accumulation of soil carbon may slow down between fire cycles, and more concerning, the previously stored carbon will be released to the atmosphere as CO2 because of increased activity by soil microorganisms. Either of these would increase the potential of climate change associated with the buildup of CO2, a potent ""greenhouse"" gas. The dominant vegetation is also projected to change with increasing fire frequency, with a projected shift from an ecosystem that has been conifer-dominated for the past 6,000 years to a deciduous-dominated ecosystem in the future.  We studied how short intervals between wildfires affects vegetation. At our field sites, we found a more open structure, low conifer regeneration, and a general decline in carbon in areas with frequent burns. Using remote sensing data, we found that the negative feedbacks hypothesized by many authors to be a damper on increasing fire despite climate change is present, but decays rapidly after a decade and as a result, short interval events are increasing in frequency across the region. This finding was also replicated in the lower 48 states of the United States. We also examined whether shorter intervals between wildfires would cause the release of CO2 from a common boreal ecosystem. In our study, the shortened return of fire (20-50 years) corresponded to the increased release of CO2 from mineral soils due soil microbes consuming soil organic carbon. This CO2 release corresponded both to an increase in soil temperature at depths where permafrost would have normally occurred, and to a shift in vegetation type. Increased burn frequency also reduced the effectiveness of ground level vegetation in removing CO2 from the atmosphere and contributions to the buildup of the surface soil organic layer. These results suggest that an increase in burn frequency will reduce the amount of soil carbon found in the boreal forest, potentially exacerbating climate change.     Future changes in soil water content and evapotranspiration in boreal regions have the potential to alter vegetation and carbon dynamics, but they are difficult to model because of the complexity and integrated processes that control and shape boreal ecological and hydrological systems. We conducted experiments with a hydrological model to better understand which parameters most influence soil water content and evapotranspiration. We found that the parameters that control how tightly soils retain water and how much plants close their stomata have the largest influences, but interactions between parameters are more important than expected. Even when these parameter values are constrained by model performance against field observations, parameter values can determine whether soils become wetter or drier in future conditions. These findings suggest that scientists using numerical models should carefully consider how parameter selection influences simulated future hydrologic conditions. Our final modeling work that is still in progress, will improve our understanding of how climate change and fire interact with the temporal and spatial pattern of individual plant species (not just functional vegetation types), and soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics at finer scales than previously evaluated in this region. This synoptic approach, at a scale relevant to management decisions, is critical, since the interactions among climate, fire frequency, and permafrost for successional dynamics and carbon dynamics are complex, tightly linked, and poorly understood in the boreal regions of the world.

"Walking through a forest, one can often smell the characteristic scents of decomposing vegetation - fragrances from the many natural chemicals (volatile organic compounds or VOCs) that are released as vegetation breaks down. These compounds not only give decomposing leaves their characteristic odor, they are also important to the chemistry of the atmosphere, and to underlying soils, where they can influence soil fertility and alter the types of organisms residing in soil. Hundreds of different VOCs can also be released by the microbes that consume vegetation on the forest floor, and microbial decay of leaves and branches from different plant species produces distinct VOCs during decomposition, contributing to the different smells of a pine versus an oak forest, for example. Scientists do not yet understand how the types and amounts of these substances vary as plant matter decomposes. Researchers also need to understand how the release of VOCs will be altered as forest composition shifts seasonally with changes in the environment. This research will not only address these knowledge gaps, it will also determine the importance of VOCs to underlying soils; how they may promote the storage of carbon in forest soils, and how they can influence soil fertility by altering nitrogen cycling and the types of microorganisms found in soils. This project will be conducted by a team of researchers both at the University of Colorado and at Virginia Tech where the project will train undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge research. In addition, researchers at these universities will use the research results to introduce high school students to key concepts and tools in the study of soils and their roles in sustaining ecosystems.<br/><br/>All decomposing plant litter emits VOCs, and the total amount of carbon (C) released as VOCs can be surprisingly high, with some litters emitting VOCs at rates approaching that of C emissions as carbon dioxide. The proposed research will use a series of field and laboratory-based studies to determine 1) how the amounts and types of VOCs emitted vary as litter decomposition progresses, 2) the sensitivity of these emissions to changes in moisture and temperature regimes, 3) the degree to which the VOCs produced during litter decomposition represent a source of organic C to underlying soils, and 4) how these VOCs impact microbial communities and key nitrogen  cycling processes in soil. Together, the proposed work will improve model representations of VOC fluxes from terrestrial ecosystems, an important objective given that some of these litter-derived VOCs can promote the formation of ozone and secondary organic aerosols in the atmosphere. In addition, this research will explore an understudied mechanism by which leaf litter can influence the biotic and abiotic characteristics of underlying soils. Ultimately this research could lead to the development of novel strategies to manage soil by identifying specific VOCs that could reduce soil pathogen loads or alter the rates of specific microbial processes that are critical to the maintenance of soil fertility.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,175454.00,175454,4900,ECOSYSTEM STUDIES,1809144,,Michael S Strickland,,Moscow,US,ID00,University of Idaho,ID,838443020,mstrickland@uidaho.edu,Michael,Strickland,mkane@nsf.gov,Matthew Kane,7032927186,['01001617DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],11/07/2017,10/01/2017,05/31/2021,Collaborative Research: Volatile organic compounds released during litter decomposition and their relevance to soil ecology,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,S,"['mSystems~2019~4~Choudoir, M., S.

These odors are the product of compounds (volatile organic compounds or VOCs) that are released by those microorganisms living in soil or in decomposing litter. Hundreds of different VOCs (including many which we cannot smell) can be emitted from individual soil or litter samples, and we know that these VOCs can have important impacts on the chemistry of the atmosphere, soil fertility, and soil food webs. With this study, we investigated the types and amounts of VOCs emitted from soils and litters, the sensitivity of these emissions to changes in environmental conditions, and how these VOC emissions can alter soil carbon dynamics, nitrogen cycling processes, and microbial communities.     This project yielded comprehensive information on VOC emissions from soil and litter, including information on how VOC emission profiles can be affected by changes in environmental conditions, particularly fluctuations in soil moisture. These results will lead to improved model representations of VOC fluxes from terrestrial ecosystems, an important objective given that some of these VOCs can promote the formation of ozone and secondary organic aerosols in the atmosphere. Second, we show that the VOCs produced by soil microbes can impact the growth and activities of other soil microbes (including known bacterial pathogens of plants). This work adds to our understanding of how microbes interact belowground and highlights the potential to leverage microbially-produced VOCs to directly or indirectly reduce agriculturally-important crop diseases. Third, we have shown that exposure to litter-derived VOCs can have significant effects on soil carbon and nitrogen cycling in mineral soils, revealing an understudied mechanism by which leaf litters can alter the rates of specific microbial processes that are critical to the maintenance of soil fertility.     This work directly contributed to the education and training of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students. This project and our findings were also integrated into undergraduate classes at the Univ. of Idaho and the Univ. of Colorado to introduce students to key tools and concepts from microbiology, soil ecology, and atmospheric chemistry.

"A region of charge separation, known as the electrical double layer, forms at the surface of most solids that are immersed in an aqueous solution. As the surface of most solids bares a slight charge, ions dissolved in the aqueous solution segregate to the surface to counterbalance this charge.  The ions closest to the surface are in close proximity to the counter charge, and then a secondary layer forms to gradually diffuse the charge formed in this layer.  When an external electric field is applied, these charged particles move in response, in a process known as electrophoresis. Electrophoretic motion can be used to separate and purify macromolecules, as different types of particles have different charges associated with them.  Electrophoresis can be used to identify or isolate target cells or biological compounds for diagnostic purposes. There is growing interest in the application of a nonlinear electric field to manipulate biological particles in microfluidic devices, as well as enabling other separations and material assembly. <br/><br/>This project will provide travel funds for twelve students to attend and participate in the 2017 Electrophoresis Society Annual Meeting of the American Electrochemical Society in Minneapolis, MN.

"In many hierarchical dynamical systems, synchrony between multiple fluctuating variables (i.e., correlations or other similarities in fluctuations between variables through time) is more important than the individual variables themselves. For instance, a neuron may fire only when all of its input neurons fire synchronously, or the electrical grid may crash only when demands of multiple users become synchronized, producing total-usage spikes. Ecosystems can show this type of dependency on synchrony. Ecosystems include multiple trophic levels, with population signals from lower levels often being spatially aggregated to affect higher levels and human concerns such as fisheries. For instance, a predator is only harmed if its prey are scarce over its whole hunting area. And human fish exploitation is only reduced if fish decline synchronously everywhere. For systems of this type, it is primarily the synchronous components of signals that matter in the average signal that affects the next hierarchical level - non-synchronous components tend to cancel in the spatial average. Thus, spatial synchrony of population dynamics is very important to ecosystem dynamics generally. Spatial synchrony of population dynamics has been widely observed in organisms as diverse as mammals and protists, at distances up to thousands of kilometers. Synchrony is closely related to large-scale outbreaks and shortages. Synchrony has conservation implications because populations are at greater risk of simultaneous extinction if they are simultaneously rare. But in spite of the importance of synchrony in ecology, possible impacts of climate change on synchrony are very little studied. In this context, climate change constitutes not just warming, but also changes in other statistical aspects of environmental signals. It is also unknown the extent to which synchrony, and climate-change-induced changes therein, can be transmitted through predator-prey interacts and hence throughout entire food webs in complex patterns. The goals of this research are: (1) to develop mathematical models and statistics to build understanding of how potential changes in synchrony induced by climate change will ramify through complex ecosystems; (2) and to develop mathematical models and use them to understand the consequences of changes in synchrony for a widely observed empirical pattern called Taylor's law, a phenomenon fundamental to spatial ecology and applied in a variety of areas including fisheries management, conservation, and agriculture. Researchers will also strive, as time allows, to understand the consequences of changes in synchrony for species extinction risk.<br/><br/>To meet goal (1) above, the researchers will perform stochastic-process modeling in a network context, to understand how changes in synchrony should theoretically cascade through complex species interaction networks; and will develop statistical methods combining wavelets and statistical path analysis, to be used to help infer how synchrony cascades through empirical interaction networks. A vector autoregressive moving average modelling framework will be constructed consisting of multiple habitat patches, with several species interacting within patches, migrating between patches, and being affected by a stochastic environment in each patch. For each species independently, dispersal and/or environmental synchronizing effects can be independently set to act directly on the species as synchronizing influences, or not. A given species may also be synchronized through its interactions with other synchronized species. The primary utility of the models is to make it possible to derive analytically, for each species, the relative importance of these direct and trophically-mediated synchronizing effects, thereby understanding the nature of trophic transmission of synchrony through the network. To meet goal (2) above, researchers will use the theory of ergodic stationary stochastic processes to represent population levels at different locations. If time allows, consequences of synchrony for extinction risk will be assessed through mathematical analysis within a classic stochastic matrix modelling framework, expanded to represent multiple populations across space.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.049,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,23391.00,23391,4900,MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY,1714353,,Sanford D Eigenbrode,875 Perimeter Dr.,Moscow,US,ID00,University of Idaho,ID,838443020,sanforde@uidaho.edu,Sanford,Eigenbrode,jwang@nsf.gov,Junping Wang,7032924488,['01001718DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/18/2017,09/01/2017,08/31/2020,Collaborative Research: Modeling and Inference for Spatiotemporal Climate Impacts on Complex Ecosystems,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,D,," The majority of the work on this project has used existing databases on flying aphids trapped in suction traps in Idaho, the USA mid-west, and the United Kingdom. These databases provide records of all aphids captured, identified to species at multiple sites of decades. The data provide insights into the trends in abundance of individual species and species compositions. The effort has focused on curating these datasets and bringing them into alignment so they can be analyzed for trends and also compared among locations. Together they represent the most comprehensive assessment of aphid communities that exists globally. Publications revealing and interpreting these patterns in light of global are in preparation with submission targets within the next few months. An example of output is provided in the figure below. In this figure, aphid species are listed across the bottom, grouped by their host breadth (Monogophagous = hosts within one plant genus; Oligophagous = hosts within one plant family; Polyphagous = hosts within many plant families). The Y axis of the figure represents years of sampling, in this case from 1985 to 2003. The colors represent total aphids captured across sites in Idaho and the legend appears above the figure. You can see on this figure that Monophagous aphids tend to exhibit abundance declines while aphids with other host breadths are more variable. The work underway parses out these effects and others to understand aphid species responses to drivers of change in the three parts of the world.  Other work that has been funded under the project uses a six-year data base of aphids sampled at 50 sites in Washington state and Idaho on wheat plants. On wheat, 12 species occur including a newly invasive aphid from the United Kingdom, Metopolophium festucae cerealium. The data are being analyzed for the effects of climate and landscape patterns on aphid communities and on the interactions between the adventive species present in wheat and this newly invasive aphid. The species respond differently to temperature, precipitation and land uses such as specific crops, perennial grasslands, urban development and other drivers.   Intellectual Merit  These efforts represent the most comprehensive assessment of aphid community trends over time that enable comparisons among locations within and between continents. Availability of extensive datasets combined with additional data on drivers at landscape and climatic levels will enable detection of patterns of global relevance concerning these important insects. Some aphids are pests but many represent native biota that occupy niches in all sorts of plant communities. How these different aphid functional groups respond to drivers of change has not yet been examined in any study. The complementary work on aphid communities on wheat help document the community level implications of an invasive species front.  Broader Impacts  Aphids are important component of ecosystems with implications for ecosystem services. Several species included in the study are also significant economic pests affecting major commodities and staple foods, so how they are responding to drivers of change has great importance for food security. Work on this portion of the project has involved efforts from two postdoctoral scientists who are combining work on aphid biology with these quantitative approaches to delineate processes with relevance at regional and global scales.

"Non-technical description<br/>One of the great challenges in modern biology is understanding how changes in amino acids that are the building blocks of proteins lead to changes in the characteristics of a living organism. This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (RII Track-2 FEC) award addresses this challenge by using computer simulations, mathematical modeling, and experiments to determine how amino acid changes modify the way that proteins interact with other molecules. This information, in turn, will elucidate how these changes modify the characteristics of organisms. This research will contribute to basic scientific knowledge and will benefit society by advancing biotechnology, agriculture, and human health. The work on protein binding, for example, will improve the ability to predict which pathogens will evade drug therapy or which molecules might interfere with protein function. The project will provide resources to support early-career faculty and mentor them in building robust, interdisciplinary, collaborative research programs. It will also provide collaborative opportunities to students and postdocs and prepare them for cutting-edge scientific careers. The research is team-based, involving scientists and students in Idaho, Vermont, and Rhode Island. Findings will be shared with the public via interactive animations, a website for dissemination of results, and presentations for diverse audiences in all three states including local science centers, schools, and regional Tribal communities. The project will promote a diverse, vibrant, and sustainable workforce and provide opportunities for research, education, and outreach.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>The research will utilize protein biophysical tools to develop genome to phenome analyses that predict the impact of mutations and combinations of mutations on a broad range of systems. The central scientific hypothesis for the project is that protein biophysical models provide an efficient framework for predicting how mutations influence protein stability, affinity for substrates and partners, and the mappings to higher-level phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, the research team will computationally predict the effect of mutations on folding and binding stabilities and experimentally validate the predictions by protein purification, circular dichroism, and isothermal titration calorimetry. The use of computational approach first to select biophysically viable mutants will lead to efficient experimental efforts. Initial studies will focus on beta-lactamase and the respiratory syncytial virus F protein because they represent two fundamental interaction types: protein-substrate and protein-protein.  The researchers will investigate how single mutations and combinations of mutations affect biophysical phenotypes and their mappings to higher-level phenotypes in these two systems. Further studies will focus on larger, naturally occurring, mutational combinations and the role of the environment in modifying the genotype to phenotype mappings. The research will identify generic and system-specific lessons about the mapping of genotypes to phenotypes, such as how often biophysical and higher-level phenotypes show epistasis and how well models predict deviations from additivity. Participating early career faculty will receive mentoring for advancement in their academic career and will have networking opportunities for professional development.  The project will develop a website to aid in the communication of project results, tools, and activities.  Students and scientists will work with animators and virtual technology and design experts to produce interactive animations called ""Geno-Pheno-Mations"" to disseminate the project results to the general public.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.083,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,6000000.00,6000000,4900,EPSCoR Research Infrastructure,1736253,,Frederick M Ytreberg,,,US,ID00,University of Idaho,ID,838443020,ytreberg@uidaho.edu,Frederick,Ytreberg,acharyas@nsf.gov,Subrata Acharya,7032922451,"['01001718DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001920DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",08/01/2017,08/01/2017,07/31/2021,RII Track-2 FEC: Using Biophysical Protein Models to Map Genetic Variation to Phenotypes,Cooperative Agreement,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Brandon Ogbunugafor', 'Craig Miller', 'Daniel M Weinreich', 'Brent L Lockwood']",M,"['Viruses~2020~12~Bedient, Lori and Pokharel, Swechha Mainali and Chiok, Kin R and Mohanty, Indira and Beach, Sierra S and Miura, Tanya A and Bose, Santanu~https://doi.org/doi: 10.3390/v12090932~~~~~Lytic Cell Death Mechanisms in Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Infected Macrophages: Roles of Pyroptosis and Necroptosis~~932~10291351~10291351~OSTI~2021-08-30 23:05:39.936~', 'PeerJ~2020~~Mirabzadeh, Christopher A and Ytreberg, F.

During the funding period, our team sought to develop a better understanding of how amino acid changes in proteins lead to changes in organisms. We used proteins from a wide variety of experimental systems, ranging from viruses to sea urchins. For all these systems, we used molecular modeling to predict how amino acid changes lead to changes in the ability of proteins to fold, and to bind to other biomolecules. We also proposed new molecular modeling techniques to address current limitations and challenges. We generated or collected large libraries of amino acid variants for our systems to allow for analysis. We subsequently developed statistical and mathematical tools to understand how single and multiple amino acid changes lead to organism changes. Finally, we developed three pieces of software designed to teach high school age teenagers about protein folding and binding, and the effects of amino acid changes on these properties (see image).

"Wildfires affect more than 180,000 km2 in the Unites States every year, on average, an area 20 times the size of Yellowstone National Park. In the Rocky Mountains, the amount of area burned in large wildfires has been increasing since the mid-1980s, a trend well linked to warming spring and summer temperatures, and expected to continue in upcoming decades. The way society plans for and reacts to wildfires, for example through federal policy and land management, is strongly shaped by our understanding of the causes, ecological consequences, and historical precedence of fire in different ecosystems. Important questions in this context include: how often have fires occurred in the past and how has this varied with climate and human activity, how have fires impacted valued resources including forests and water quality, and how long does it take for ecosystems to recover to pre-fire conditions? Studying how and why forests and wildfire activity have varied in the past, over periods of varying climate and human activity, provides a critical foundation for understanding the implications of wildfires. This long-term perspective also helps inform and improve models that simulate the impacts of future environmental change, including changes in wildfire activity. Mechanisms for broader impacts include documenting and communicating research results via a journalism graduate student embedded with the research team, advancing STEM education through the development of forest and fire ecology curricula for high school educators, and training graduate and undergraduate students in field-, lab-, and modeling-based research.<br/><br/>This research investigates the relationships and feedbacks among changes in climate, wildfire activity, and ecosystems over the past 2500 years through a unique combination of paleoecological reconstructions and ecosystem modeling. Using an unusually dense network of lake-sediment records in two study regions (i.e., 9-12 lakes within 1000 km2 in the N. and S. Rockies), the frequency, severity, and synchrony of past fire activity will be characterized and compared to paleoclimate records to assess the drivers of past fire activity. Paleofire records will be supplemented with high-resolution records of vegetation and biogeochemical change at a subset of focal sites, to assess the ecosystem impacts of past fire activity.

Drought and wildfire caused by changing precipitation patterns, increased temperatures and fuel loads, and decades of fire suppression are affecting forest biogeochemical cycles at local to continental scales. The way society plans for and reacts to wildfires, for example through federal policy and land management, is strongly shaped by our understanding of the causes, ecological consequences, and historical precedence of fire in different ecosystems. This research investigated important questions in this context including: how often have fires occurred in the past and how has this varied with climate and human activity, how have fires impacted valued resources including forests and water quality, and how long does it take for ecosystems to recover to pre-fire conditions? We used a novel combination of paleo reconstructions and ecosystem modeling to provide knowledge about climate-fire-ecosystem dynamics over the past 2500 years. By integrating our paleo reconstructions, modern terrestrial ecosystem carbon and nitrogen measurements, and state-of-the-art ecosystem and Earth system modeling, this research has yielded insights about forest response to wildfire and climate change while training the next generation of carbon cycle scientists and educators.  Key outcomes of this work include six peer-reviewed publications, two PhD dissertations, dozens of conference presentations, training for one postdoctoral researcher, three undergraduate research experiences, and an education curriculum publicly available for use by all high school teachers. Over half of the trainees were from underrepresented groups. Moreover, our work led to partnerships with national NGO's (The Nature Conservancy, American Forests) with whom we continue to work with to accelerate research progress and communicate results to land managers and policy makers.  Finally, we have communicated our work at numerous public outreach venues and events, including Earth Day celebrations, science caf&eacute;'s, land-grant extension workshops, local news outlets, and national public radio.  We have made significant advances of knowledge about how wildfire affects forest ecosystem carbon and nitrogen dynamics, over days to millennia, and from watershed to regional scales. Most importantly, we found that:   In Hudiburg et al., 2017, we modeled post-fire carbon and nitrogen dynamics over millennia using paleo-fire records. We found the fire regime variability in the paleo-fire records created legacies in soil C trajectories that lasted for millennia. Our results show that fire-regime variability is a major driver of C trajectories in stand-replacing fire regimes, an interaction that could not have been uncovered without our novel paleo-model integration. In Bartowitz et al., 2019 we continued the millennial-scale exploration of the interactions between fire and carbon dynamics of subalpine forests. We scaled this study to multiple forest types and tested the impact of varying fire frequency over two millennia on ecosystem productivity and carbon storage. We found that high fire frequency led to overall lower carbon stocks compared to scenarios with lower fire frequencies, highlighting the importance of fire-frequency in determining ecosystem carbon storage. In Bartowitz et al., 2022, we calculated forest fire emissions for modern (1984-present) fires across the western US and compared those emissions to the 1910 Big Burn, fossil fuel emissions (FFE), and harvest carbon losses. We found that forest fire carbon emissions are on average only 6% of anthropogenic FFE over the past decade. In addition, we saw that the Big Burn of 1910 continues to be the ‘biggest’ (in size) single forest fire event in the contiguous USA, with the highest carbon emissions.

"Retreat of the leading edge of marine-terminating glaciers is often associated with ice flow acceleration, increases in iceberg calving rates and discharge to the sea, and glacier thinning. The associated ice mass loss is responsible for approximately half the contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet to sea level rise thus far this century. For the remainder of the century and beyond, gaps in our understanding of iceberg calving and glacier retreat result in large uncertainties in predictions of mass loss and consequent sea level rise. This collaborative project is designed to reveal the factors controlling terminus retreat and iceberg calving in the diverse settings of Greenland's marine terminating glaciers. The project contributes to STEM workforce development by providing support to two early-career scientists from EPSCoR states, undergraduate student participation at both institutions, and for training of a graduate student.  The principal investigators will continue their active outreach, including museum and classroom visits in the rural settings around their universities, presentations to non-technical groups, and media features.<br/><br/>This project will substantially improve our understanding of marine terminating glacier dynamics via the analysis of recently-available observational datasets. Through these data, the project will evaluate the performance of terminus parameterizations used in numerical ice sheet models, known as ""calving laws."" Application at 49 diverse marine-terminating glaciers around Greenland (nearly a quarter of the ice sheet total) ensures that project results will be representative. Calving laws applied to conditions at and near glacier termini will predict terminus locations. Predictions will be compared to terminus positions observed in satellite and time-lapse images to identify model misfits. This calibration and validation analysis will reveal when and where specific calving laws reliably reproduce terminus positions and calving rates. Furthermore, extensions of this approach will (1) yield insight into the impact of crevasse water storage on iceberg calving, (2) guide the inclusion of submarine melting to improve prediction by calving laws, and (3) quantify the critical timescales over which glacier properties must be characterized for the prediction of calving rates and terminus positions.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,140234.00,140234,4900,ANS-Arctic Natural Sciences,1716865,,Timothy C Bartholomaus,"875 Perimeter Drive, MS 3021",Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443021,tbartholomaus@uidaho.edu,Timothy,Bartholomaus,mstiegli@nsf.gov,Marc Stieglitz,7032924354,['0100XXXXDB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/26/2017,08/01/2017,07/31/2021,Collaborative Research:  What Controls Calving?

The great majority of this sea level increase comes from the diminishment of the world?s glaciers and ice sheets and this ice loss is expected to increase in the coming years and centuries.  However the rate at which sea level will increase in the future is uncertain, in large part due to the limited understanding of the ways by which glaciers break apart into the ocean, a process known as iceberg calving.  In this project we discovered the most accurate ways to simulate iceberg calving around the Greenland Ice Sheet in computer simulations of ice sheet change, made other fundamental advances in understanding calving and glacier fracture, and helped establish research and teaching programs at two universities in Idaho, a state with a relatively weak history of federal research productivity.  The primary goal for this project was to evaluate the numerical rules that ice sheet models use to simulate calving.  Each computer simulation of Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheet change needs to include a way to describe iceberg calving.  Many such descriptions now exist in various publications, but the effectiveness of these models had not been evaluated.  In a study led by University of Idaho M.S. student Tristan Amaral, we found that the formulation termed the Crevasse Penetration model was able to reproduce glacier terminus positions consistently around the entirety of the Greenland Ice Sheet margin and with relatively little sensitivity to poorly constrained parameters.  Different models, including some of the more recent and popular models, performed poorly when applied in a consistent manner across the entirety of the ice sheet.  It is our hope and expectation that this work will represent a landmark benchmark for model validation going forward, and that it will ultimately enable projections of ice sheet change and sea level rise going forward that are more credible than previously possible.  This project also enabled another model validation study of crevasse occurrence.  Crevassing is the process of opening fractures within glacier ice that often reach 10 or more meters below the ice surface.  Crevasses are expected to open under tensile stresses that pull a glacier apart, however, we found no relationship between crevasse depth and local stresses, and only a weak relationship between stress history and crevasse depth.  This is at odds with almost all currently used models of crevassing and is important to studies of iceberg calving due to the common dependance of crevassing and calving on mechanical ice fracture.  Several other studies initiated under this grant have examined the role of vertical shear in common models of ice shelf flow and the links between calving and melt processes and the size distribution of icebergs in proglacial fjords.  A final promising study examines the occurrence of quasi-periodic rifts that occur as glaciers detach from fjord walls and glacier pinning points.  Each of these studies (either drafted or already submitted for review) is poised to improve our understanding of one of the most critical processes by which glaciers and ice sheets lose mass and contribute to sea level rise.  Beyond these fundamental contributions to glaciology, this project has also had a major impact on the professional development of researchers at the two leading research institutions within the State of Idaho, University of Idaho and Boise State University.  This project has been the first NSF-funded project led by PI Bartholomaus, and promoted the close collaboration of PIs Bartholomaus and Enderlin, at two institutions striving to increase their federally funded research.  Additionally, this work has supported the studies of four different graduate students, including one Ph.D. student, and three undergraduate students.  M.S. graduate students have since been able to apply the analytical and communication skills honed during this project to work as Physical Scientists for the National Park Service and Natural Resource Conservation Service, as a Ph.D. student, and as a university instructor and environmental consultant.  Undergraduate students developed scientific computing experience and exposure to the geosciences that would not have otherwise been possible.  Finally, and circling back to the ultimate goal of this project, this project led to a range of outreach activities to the ice sheet modeling community to strengthen model projections and therefore increase confidence in projections of sea level rise that planners worldwide can use.

"A recent technological revolution in DNA sequencing has fundamentally changed the amount of genetic information that researchers can collect. This has led to the development of a new field in biology called population genomics. This field examines the processes of genetic evolution in natural populations of many living things at a remarkably fine scale, scanning across the genome - the entire collection of genetic information for each individual studied. Population genomics promises remarkable insights into population dynamics, adaptation, the genetics of important traits, and other areas of biology. However, researchers lack adequate tools for analyzing the rapidly growing amount of data, limiting the insights that they are able to draw. This project addresses this gap with an experimental approach to population genomics, using laboratory populations of yeast, and by developing sophisticated new analytical tools for population genomic data. The experimental approach provides a controlled setting for testing hypotheses about how evolution and adaptation affect variation across the genome, and it produces data to evaluate the performance of new analytical tools. These analytical tools will be disseminated to the scientific community, which will improve the ability of biologists to test and predict responses of populations to environmental change, gene flow, and evolution. Undergraduates, graduate students, and a post-doctoral scholar will be trained, and the research team will participate in outreach and training efforts to facilitate the use of these new tools in the population genomics community.<br/><br/>This project will focus on the scenario of populations under divergent selection with or without gene flow, using replicate laboratory populations of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Populations will be grown under various levels of selection, migration, and recombination, and subjected to high-throughput sequencing to assess the impact of these factors on genetic differentiation at two scales: (1) the chromosomal region around single loci under divergent selection, and (2) the entire genome, under polygenic adaptation and divergence. The project will also develop novel analytical tools, based on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), to determine which statistics calculated from population genomic data are most informative about underlying evolutionary processes, and to infer evolutionary parameters under complex models of divergent selection. The experimental data from yeast will provide test cases for the novel ABC-based methods, when the important factors, such as migration and selection, are known and experimentally controlled.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,699389.00,699389,4900,EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS,1655809,,Paul A Hohenlohe,875 Perimeter Drive,Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443051,hohenlohe@uidaho.edu,Paul,Hohenlohe,lrissler@nsf.gov,Leslie J.

We evolved laboratory populations of brewer's yeast to test the effects of selection, migration, and sexual reproduction, and we used high-throughput DNA sequencing to examine the genetic consequences.  Our results generally matched our expectations around selection and migration rate, but sexual reproduction introduced an unexpectedly wide range of variation among experimental replicates.  We also developed novel statistical tools for analyzing population genomic data, and validated these tools with our experimental data.  Because of the multiple interacting factors that make statistical inference complex, we used a technique called Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), which relies on computer simulations of evolving populations.  Intellectual Merit: Our experimental evolution approach differs from most previous experimental evolution work that has focused on genetically uniform populations and the role of new mutations in single environments.  In contrast, we used genetically diverse populations under divergent selection among environments, with migration among populations.  These scenarios more closely match natural populations where researchers commonly gather population genomic data, so our approach offers an experimental analog to natural systems.  Our result of striking variation introduced by sexual reproduction suggests that researchers searching for genes under selection in natural populations may face uncertainty in identifying specific genes.  Our statistical modeling has also demonstrated the power, as well as the limits, of identifying genes under selection based on genomic data from natural populations.  Broader Impacts: This project has contributed to training and mentorship of future scientists, including three graduate students, one postdoctoral researcher, two research technicians, and a total of eight undergraduate students.  These researchers developed skills in microbiology, molecular biology, DNA sequence analysis, and statistical modeling.  We have spread our understanding to the scientific community, primarily through teaching in workshops focused on data analysis approaches for population genomics for a wide range of students, researchers, and professionals.  We have also disseminated our results through publications and presentations at several scientific conferences.       Last Modified: 12/16/2022       Submitted by: Paul A Hohenlohe"
"PI Name: Erik R. Coats<br/>Proposal Number: 1705728<br/><br/>Resource recovery from waste has been advocated for decades. Intensified resource recovery is now being advocated by and within the wastewater industry; wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have even been re-branded as water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) in an effort to emphasize resource value. Linked with resource recovery processes is the need to improve WRRF efficiency -- specifically in the use of energy and removal of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). This project will advance a deeper understanding and knowledge of how bacteria present in WRRFs convert ammonia to nitrite; by stopping the biological reaction at nitrite (in contrast to the more conventional conversion fully to nitrate), energy savings can be realized. The PIs will investigate this process within the context of achieving maximum biological removal of wastewater N and P. Complementing the wastewater nutrient removal research, investigations will be conducted to recover wastewater carbon as a commercially viable plastic; this resource recovery alternative could enhance the overall economics of WRRFs. The research project will engage two graduate students with both an environmental engineering professor and practicing engineers; the combined experience will provide students with significant depth and breadth in the analysis and design of wastewater resource recovery systems.<br/><br/>This project will address the following research questions: (i) Post-anoxic biological nutrient removal (BNR) with nitritation: What operational conditions must be applied to sustain this enrichment and maintain nitritation? How robust/resilient is the nitritating post-anoxic BNR process? What is the relative speciation of Nitrobacter spp. and Nitrospira spp. under sustained nitritation, and how is mainstream nitritation sustained with nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) present? (ii) Polyhydroxybutyrate-co-valerate (PHBV) synthesis: How do interactions between carbon/electron pathways (in particular the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle and PHBV synthesis) affect how mixed microbial consortia (MMC) maximize volatile fatty acid (VFA) conversion to PHBV? What is the relationship between these interactions and substrate addition/bulk solution VFA concentrations under maximum PHBV synthesis conditions? How can metabolomics data inform process operations? The following hypotheses address the research questions: (1) Stable and resilient mainstream nitritation can be sustained with an enrichment of Nitrobacter spp. over Nitrospira spp. The targeted enrichment and outcome (nitritation) can be achieved through the control of the aeration period. (2) By controlling bulk-solution VFA concentrations in the PHBV batch reactor, maximum conversion of VFAs to PHBV can be achieved. This study will generate knowledge to advance a new technology such that enhanced N and P removal can be more reliably accomplished through sustainable biological means with a reduced energy footprint.

We taught two classes each day for 4 weeks in Y2. We engaged multiple undergraduate and graduate students to assist in this collaboration; the student team was diverse culturally and by gender. We collected aquarium water quality data for the students (temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, turbidity). We also collected other water samples - creek water, WWTP effluent - to compare and contrast. The students recorded our data daily, and then we helped them in graphically presenting the results. In this module we focused on the importance of water quality for aquatic life, drinking water, recreation, etc. Students were engaged through inquiry and experimental design, as well as data analysis and interpretation.

"Conifers are globally important, both ecologically and economically. Many conifer species have recently experienced extreme mortality events due to drought, fire and insect outbreaks. There is an urgent need to understand conifer physiology, and especially conifer needles - the organs responsible for carbon uptake and regulation of water loss. Conifers have an intriguing paradox in the link between their leaf anatomy and physiology: with such a simplistic, single-vein vascular system, how can they compete with broadleaf species or inhabit extreme environments? This project aims to understand how conifer leaf anatomy influences water transport and photosynthesis, and how needle water transport declines during drought. This information will then be used to develop a mechanistic model to help predict forest productivity and mortality in response to drought and other environmental challenges. The project will provide training for a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and multiple undergraduate students. Also, in collaboration with the McCall Outdoor Science School, 5th and 6th grade students, their parents and teachers will participate in a workshop called ""What happens inside a leaf?"" To illustrate how cellular-level modifications can influence landscape processes, 3D-printed conifer needle models generated from X-ray imaging will be used. Anatomical models will be freely available through a website for teachers and students to 3D print hand-held models at schools, or as teaching kits for schools without access to 3D printing technology. <br/><br/>Conifers inhabit some of the driest and coldest habitats where trees are found.  Many conifer species are threatened by heat waves and droughts that induce physiological stress that can make them more vulnerable to pests and pathogens. Although most conifer leaves have only a single vein supplying water to the leaf, the internal anatomy outside the vein is incredibly diverse across the conifer phylogeny. The impact of this diversity on water transport and carbon uptake is unknown. The primary goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic framework to understand the influence of conifer leaf anatomy on leaf hydraulic conductance and photosynthetic capacity. This mechanistic understanding will be used to illuminate how conifers have adapted to arid and cold environments and have also been able to successfully compete with angiosperm species over evolutionary history.

Through this work, the Co-PI investigated adaptation at the science-policy interface, including the development of salmon habitat restoration science and institutions in the Columbia River Basin. The scientific community contributes valuable knowledge that influences environmental management in the region. As such, understanding how this community is dealing with and adapting to climate change was a main goal.  This work contributes to the fields of science, technology, and society, as well as environmental policy and management, creating a conceptual framework for understanding adaptation in science. In addition to improving the dissertation research that the Co-PI was able to conduct, the grant also resulted in peer-reviewed publications, conference talks, and a book manuscript.  The research publications and findings describe how:  Knowledge infrastructures and institutions that were developed historically in the basin influence the science that is being conducted today, including the kinds of scientific data that are valued and collected. This, in turn, has shaped the community and the culture of scientists, as well as the range of questions and data  to address environmental issues.  Values influence the ?best available science? in any adaptive management planning. These values should be clarified and communicated by making standards of evidence transparent, acknowledging aims and goals, and dealing with uncertainty by clarifying the parameters of this uncertainty. Setting environmental baselines enables and constrains potential environmental management actions because these baselines are enrolled in regulatory programs to meet legal mandates. How these baselines are determined should be an important consideration as climate change influences existing baselines and may require new baselines to be established that anticipate the effects of climate change in the region.  Ecological restorationists adapt their practices to climate change by using several strategies, including facilitating the emergence of new tools and methods, acclimating their practices toward the future, and employing models to anticipate future conditions. These strategies should be acknowledged and fostered in order to increase adaptive capacity within the scientific community.

"Understanding what helps and hinders rapid adaptation is crucial to predict organism responses to changing environments. Iceland's dynamic landscape provides a natural laboratory of fast-paced changes shaped by glaciers, volcanoes, and severe oceanic storms. The focus of this project is marine stickleback fish that have colonized multiple freshwater lakes, and thus have evolved in waters differing dramatically in clarity. The research examines sensory system evolution to ask if eyes get better at seeing in murky water, or if fish instead evolve better senses of smell and touch. The project identifies how genes and environment contribute to sensory system adaptation in different environments. The project gives young scientists cutting-edge training in multiple disciplines, generating a scientific workforce to help deal with large-scale environmental issues our society faces. Outreach efforts in museums and schools educate young and old alike on evolutionary changes driven by environmental change.<br/><br/>This research studies adaptation of sight, smell, and touch in extreme sensory environments. It assesses how differences in sensory systems affect survival from predators in murky glacial and clear lakes. The research reveals how genetic variation and gene expression differ, and reconstructs the history of colonization and the extent of parallel evolution of these traits in multiple lakes.

We hypothesized that the populations that colonized the glacial lakes had evolved either to ""disinvest"" in the visual system, utilizing predominantly other sensory systems. Alternatively, these populations may have evolved changes to their visual systems to more accurately and efficiently extract information from this visually challenging environment. We analyzed and compared eye size, ocular lens size, retinal structure, and the expression of key functional components of rod and cone photoreceptors. To estimate peak spectral sensitivity of these components, we and collaborators developed a pipeline using molecular and mathematical modeling that was applied to other fishes including zebrafish, cichlids, medaka, Atlantic salmon, and a deep-sea fish. These modeling efforts provided new insights into visual system evolution and adaptation to the range of visual environments encountered by these fishes.                 Through the course of this project, we discovered that a rather large proportion of the threespine stickleback fish sampled for our studies were infected with the larval forms of a parasite, known as ""eye flukes."" These infections caused disruption within the eye tissues needed for our proposed analyses, such that we were unable to make use of these analyses with confidence in our conclusions. Upon further study, we recognized that the retinas of the infected fish appeared to respond to damage by the parasites by engaging in a regenerative response. Infected retinas displayed signs of retinal damage, expressed a marker for cell proliferation, and displayed structural organization resembling that of regenerated retina in other systems. Retinal regeneration in response to experimental forms of damage in fish commonly used as model organisms (e.g. zebrafish), is well-documented and of high interest. To our knowledge, however, our findings regarding the potential regenerative response to parasite damage may be the first evidence that such a response may take place in wild fish. A key outcome of this project is therefore, surprisingly, a possible ecologically relevant model for retinal regeneration in response to a naturally occurring form of retinal damage.

"In-channel vegetation, IAV, is ubiquitous in watercourse as plants or algae. It provides many vital ecological and hydromorphological functions and is becoming a major tool in river restoration. Research on IAV has chiefly focused on sediment transport and flow resistance, while its role in inducing hyporheic exchange has been neglected. Hyporheic exchange is the main process connecting streams with streambeds by moving in-stream water in and out of the streambed sediment through the hyporheic zone, HZ, which serves as an interface between surface and ground waters. The HZ promotes important biological and chemical processes, which affect the quality of both stream and streambed waters. Consequently, modeling hyporheic fluxes due to IAV will provide key information for river restoration practices in which planting has been advocated, a $1B per year industry. Additionally, predictions of hyporheic exchange and processes are essential to quantify solute transport and transformation along streams and rivers. Thus the goal of this research is to model hyporheic flow due to IAV. This will provide a fundamental and predictive understanding of the processes that control hyporheic exchange due to flow and IAV interaction. It will advance knowledge on hyporheic flow field near the rhizosphere, the region of sediment directly influenced by root secretions and associated soil microorganisms and the ability to model solute, nutrient, contaminant, and pathogen transport along stream networks by including the effect of IAV. The models developed in this project will be used to predict hyporheic processes in streams with vegetation and will be incorporated into basin-scale transport models of solute and nutrients. A new transformative after school program will be developed to introduce 5th-6th grade students to STEM disciplines through hands-on activities and lessons with a mobile educational flume. In addition undergraduate and graduate Civil Engineering students will be trained. <br/><br/>The scientific goal of this project is to mechanistically understand, quantify, and model the effects of IAV on hyporheic exchange as a function of IAV density, patch size, and patch distribution under different flow conditions. IAVs will be considered with three schematizations: 1) interaction between flow and an individual emergent and submerged vegetation stem, 2) interaction between flow and one single submerged vegetation patch, and 3) interaction between flow and multiple submerged vegetation patches. This will be addressed with novel tracer test flume experiments, coupling Matching Index Reflectometry, Particle Image Velocimetry, and analytical and numerical modeling, and by testing three specific hypotheses: hyporheic exchange has an inverse U-shaped (increases to a maximum and then decreases with increasing value of the independent variable) relationship with: (1) IAV density; (2) IAV patch size; and (3) the percent of streambed covered by multiple dense IAV patches. <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,558035.00,616351,4900,Hydrologic Sciences,1559348,,Daniele Tonina,322 E Front Street,Boise,US,ID02,University of Idaho,ID,837020322,dtonina@uidaho.edu,Daniele,Tonina,heali@nsf.gov,Hendratta Ali,7032922648,"['01001617DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",04/27/2016,09/01/2016,08/31/2025,The role of in-channel aquatic vegetation on hyporheic exchange,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Ralph S Budwig'],,"['Frontiers in Earth Science~2019~7~Basham William, Ralph Budwig, Daniele Tonina~10.3389/feart.2019.00195~~~~~Seeded Grains to Identify Highly Irregular Solid Boundaries and Simplify PIV measurements~~~~~~2020-07-29 06:00:29.213~', 'Geophysical Research Letters~2021~48~Brandon Hilliard, William J Reeder, Richard S Skifton, Ralph Budwig, Daniele Tonina~~~~~~Revealing the interstitial flows and porous media architecture~~~~~~2021-08-19 14:07:10.140~', 'Water Resources Research~2020~56~T.

"In a changing world the systems we have traditionally relied on to deliver food, energy and water are now challenged by increasing risks of disruption from climate, extreme events and deteriorating infrastructure. However, advances in our ability to re-use materials and improve the efficiency of their transformation now allow us to develop innovative solutions toward an integrated production landscape for the food, energy and water system (FEWS). This project uses the coupled agricultural landscapes and communities of the Upper Snake River in the American West to measure the use of energy inputs, internal flows, and outputs of the FEWS (including industrial and urban systems) to determine how best to re-claim and re-use matter and energy flows (ReFEWS). Working closely with a Stakeholder Advisory Group (SAG), consisting of community, industry and agency mangers, the research team downscales food, energy and water dynamics so as to apply the best reclamation technologies in right place at the right time. The team then models the costs and trade-offs of applying these technologies at the landscape scale. The ReFEWS project is in direct response to national policy goals that seek to create resilient communities and landscapes as a way to promote sustainable food and energy production, and ultimately security. To ensure that the research advances basic science while ensuring translatable products, the research team uses a three tiered system of academic research, stakeholder engagement and coordinated education and outreach.<br/><br/><br/>The research characterizes the efficiency of the socio-metabolism of the Upper Snake FEWS by modeling three components: 1. the optimization parameters of nutrient, energy, and water use and reuse; 2. robustness, or the capacity to modify the FEWS through technological intervention under a range of environmental conditions; 3. and resilience, the ability to sustain configurations of FEWS use and reuse in a watershed over time and in changing social and environmental conditions. Using a systems approach, the research incorporates several key components that must be considered concurrently: a. Human behaviors for acquiring matter and energy; i.e., food, energy, and water resources; b. Infrastructure and systems that support those behaviors, including technological interventions; c. thermodynamic principles governing food, energy, and water use and waste (i.e., entropy); d. The flows of nutrients, energy, or water to minimize system entropy; e. The flow of nutrients and energy out of bounded systems in the form of waste streams and, f. The social controls to encourage or enforce behaviors that minimize system entropy. Research question 1 tests the hypothesis that waste and resource streams from food and agricultural production are greater than waste and resource streams for domestic household consumption, and changes to the agro-ecological sector can have the largest influence on the resilience of the overall FEW system. Research question 2 tests the hypothesis that no single technology is appropriate or sufficient for managing a given waste stream, and integrated recovery systems that account for secondary and tertiary waste products are the most useful for optimizing a FEWS. Research question 3 tests the hypothesis that constraints on minimizing system entropy and waste are not primarily at the technological interface (i.e., a lack of engineering solutions) but at the adoption/social interface.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.075,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,2698207.00,2698207,4900,Track 3 INFEWS,1639524,,Lilian Alessa,,,US,ID00,University of Idaho,ID,838443020,alessa@uidaho.edu,Lilian,Alessa,roconnor@nsf.gov,Robert O'Connor,7032927263,"['01001617DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001718DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",09/06/2016,09/01/2016,06/30/2021,"INFEWS/T3: Social-ecological-technological solutions to waste reuse in food, energy, and water systems (ReFEWS)",Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Richard Lammers', 'Andrew D Kliskey']",,"['Sustainability~2021~13~Kliskey, Andrew and Williams, Paula and Griffith, David L. and Dale, Virginia H. and Schelly, Chelsea and Marshall, Anna-Maria and Gagnon, Valoree S. and Eaton, Weston M. and Floress, Kristin~https://doi.org/10.3390/su13042160~~~~~Thinking Big and Thinking Small: A Conceptual Framework for Best Practices in Community and Stakeholder Engagement in Food, Energy, and Water Systems~~2160~10226303~10226303~OSTI~2021-05-06 05:15:22.696~', 'Science of The Total Environment~2020~705~Villamor, Grace B. and Kliskey, Andrew D. and Griffith, David L. and de Haro-Marti, Mario E. and Martinez, Audrey M. and Alfaro, Maribel and Alessa, Lilian~10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135817~~~~~Landscape social-metabolism in food-energy-water systems: Agricultural transformation of the Upper Snake River Basin~~135817~10141596~10141596~OSTI~2020-05-30 10:59:31.190~', 'Socio-Environmental Systems Modelling~2019~2~Villamor, Grace B. and Griffith, David L. and Kliskey, Andrew and Alessa, Lilian~10.18174/sesmo.2020a16312~~~~~Contrasting stakeholder and scientist conceptual models of food-energy-water systems: a case study in Magic Valley, Southern Idaho~~16312~10141597~10141597~OSTI~2020-03-27 17:01:51.296~', 'Science of The Total Environment~2019~651~Huang, Li and Liao, Felix Haifeng and Lohse, Kathleen A. and Larson, Danelle M. and Fragkias, Michail and Lybecker, Donna L. and Baxter, Colden V.~10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.09.260~~~~~Land conservation can mitigate freshwater ecosystem services degradation due to climate change in a semiarid catchment: The case of the Portneuf River catchment, Idaho, USA~~1796 to 1809~10095046~10095046~OSTI~2019-05-24 15:01:51.753~', 'Environmental Science &amp; Policy~2019~94~Kliskey, Andrew and Abatzoglou, John and Alessa, Lilian and Kolden, Crystal and Hoekema, David and Moore, Brandon and Gilmore, Sarah and Austin, Gary~10.1016/j.envsci.2019.01.009~~~~~Planning for Idaho?s waterscapes: A review of historical drivers and outlook for the next 50 years~~191 to 201~10095050~10095050~OSTI~2019-05-24 15:01:51.30~', 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences~2018~115~Ficklin, Darren L. and Abatzoglou, John T. and Robeson, Scott M. and Null, Sarah E. and Knouft, Jason H.~10.1073/pnas.1801026115~~~~~Natural and managed watersheds show similar responses to recent climate change~~8553 to 8557~10095054~10067186~OSTI~2019-05-24 15:01:52.796~', 'Sustainability~2018~10~Castro, Antonio and Quintas-Soriano, Cristina and Brandt, Jodi and Atkinson, Carla and Baxter, Colden and Burnham, Morey and Egoh, Benis and García-Llorente, Marina and Julian, Jason and Martín-López, Berta and Liao, Felix and Running, Katrina and Vaughn,~10.3390/su10051516~~~~~Applying Place-Based Social-Ecological Research to Address Water Scarcity: Insights for Future Research~~1516~10058566~10058566~OSTI~2018-06-01 15:01:47.30~', 'Climate Research~2017~74~Feng, W and Abatzoglou, JT and Hicke, JA and Liao, FHF~10.3354/cr01485~~~~~Interannual county-level climate-yield relationships for winter wheat on the Columbia Plateau, USA~~71 to 79~10058568~10058568~OSTI~2018-06-01 15:01:48.653~', 'Agronomy~2021~11~Leytem, April B. and Williams, Paula and Zuidema, Shan and Martinez, Audrey and Chong, Yen Leng and Vincent, Alyssa and Vincent, Aaron and Cronan, Daniel and Kliskey, Andrew and Wulfhorst, J.

Understanding the trajectories of change in food, energy, and water systems is imperative for sustainable futures on Earth that balance food production, water availability, and energy needs. This project developed a series of solutions for reusing and minimizing  water use, reducing energy use, and reusing nutrients in the dairy and feed  crop sectors. The approach was tested and applied to a case-study in the Magic  Valley, southern Idaho that looked at dairy production, feed crop production,  and related food processing in this part of the Upper Snake River Basin. Over  the four-year project the research team met with a 12-person stakeholder  advisory group every 6-months so that the outcomes from the research were not  only stakeholder-informed but strongly stakeholder-driven. The  food-energy-water system solutions were informed by hydrological simulations  and landuse simulations that supported a geodesign approach for representing a  range of scenarios for the Magic Valley through 2050.        Based on stakeholder input, a series of critical uncertainties were identified that are expected to shape the future trajectories for the Magic Valley including: sufficient water supply for demand; change in water quality regulations; allocation of resources impacting growth; best use of water as the main driver, and; agriculture as a national security tool. Six scenarios were co-developed by stakeholders and researchers including a baseline scenario, along with five alternatives with varying types and degrees of change: 1. Business as Usual: Baseline change in population, climate, and water use; 2. The Court Calls: Court decisions lead to shifts in water allocation and demand; 3. Locavore: Population growth leads to increased residential development and a shift to local food production; 4. Population Boom: In migration from other states exacerbates competition for land and attracts alternative industries; 5.  Megadrought: Prolonged and extreme drought leads to decommissioned agricultural land, and; 6. Happy Valley: Stable rainfall leads to increased food production despite warming temperatures. The representation of the six scenarios, along with decadal timesteps, were iterated successively by the stakeholder group. An integrated suite of solutions were co-produced for each scenario based on stakeholders knowledge and past experiences.  To understand the impact of each scenario on water availability and use a hydrological model, the water balance model (WBM), was developed and applied. The WBM is a   computer model that simulates water flows and storages throughout the Upper   Snake River Basin.  The model incorporates   the major components of the hydrological cycle and, most importantly, the   extensive human changes to the water cycle in this region.  Snowmelt in the mountains enters the rivers   and moves downstream to the Magic Valley where the water is used mainly for   irrigated agriculture, but also for the livestock, industrial and domestic   sectors.  Reservoirs and canals are an   important part of the system, and they serve to delay the flow of river   water and move that water to farmers' fields.  This project has allowed us to represent   groundwater in the WBM and its interactions with agricultural water use and   reuse and to begin work on exploring how hydrological models handle multi-reservoir systems as characterized by the Upper Snake River.  The study has produced notable publications ranging from modeling human decisions, to identifying greater efficiencies in the use of irrigation technology, to documenting practices for stakeholder engagement and knowledge co-production. A significant outcome of the project has been a digital atlas portraying the six scenarios, modeled impacts, and identification of integrated solutions (Magic Valley INFEWS Digital URL: https://the-infews-atlas-magic-valley-idaho-alternative-futures-uidaho.hub.arcgis.com/). Finally, this project represents the outcome of collaborative team-based science among the Center for Resilient Communities at Univeristy of Idaho, the Water Analysis Research Group at University of New Hampshire, the Southern Oregon University, and the Magic Valley stakeholder advisory group.

"This project examines conceptions of space and time in water quality governance among indigenous peoples of the western United States in order to better understand disproportionate threats to water quality in indigenous communities and struggles to assert governance over waters. Water is fundamentally connected to both time and space in many indigenous ontologies; its stewardship is a cultural value. Despite the belief of water's central role in networks of non-human living and non-living beings, indigenous peoples have experienced difficulties in the management of their waters. Not only do tribes face broad-based restrictions over the control of water quality on their lands; centuries of colonization, economic exploitation, and the assertion of primacy in water jurisdiction by states has diminished governance options. This research recognizes that conceptions of space and time are central to both water as a whole, and water as it is governed. Spatio-temporalities are fundamental to the establishment of values and vital to socio-cultural relationships. Moreover, since water flows across cultural boundaries and political borders, its governance forces interactions between people with different spatial and temporal experiences, which challenges power dynamics, justice, and equity. The broader impacts of this work address disparities in access to resources and the improved well-being of individuals in society, particularly with regard to diverse worldviews and their role in resource management. This work additionally supports the participation of underrepresented minorities in research as well as increased partnerships between academia and tribal communities by exploring serious threats to water quality that disproportionately affect particular communities. <br/><br/>This research specifically asks: 1) How are space and time recognized, represented, and acted upon in water quality governance by tribal communities?  2) How do various interpretations of space and time between tribal, federal, state and local governments facilitate or inhibit tribes from asserting authority and building capacity in water quality governance? Working collaboratively with the Northern Arapaho and Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribes, this research employs elements of Actor-Network Theory (ANT) as a conceptual framework and Participatory Mapping (PM) as a method to collaborate with community members in investigations of particular water quality concerns. Research will culminate in a symposium to understand ways in which results relate to water quality governance to indigenous communities across the United States.

Indigenous conceptions of time and space are complex and often not linear. For example, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson describes Nishnaabeg understandings of the world as ""&hellip;networked because the modes of communication and interaction between beings occur in complex nonlinear forms, across time and space"" (2017, 23). Mishuana Goeman (2013) writes, ""The danger of identities fixed in time and space is well known to Native people&mdash;what becomes elided in the colonial political bind are the histories of movement and mobility of people and ideas"" (p. 179). This research explored such understandings of space and time as they relate to water, and more specifically, water quality, asking questions like: Who decides the quality of water, and how is it decided?  How do different conceptions of space and time between governing entities (e.g. state, federal, Tribal governments) facilitate or inhibit Tribes from building capacity in water quality governance? Our research team worked with the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe and the Nez Perce Tribe to better understand these and related questions.

This agreement outlined an approach to research supported by both Tribes, and included research ethics, protocol, and plans for dissemination. Working groups, consisting of Tribal government experts in water quality, natural resources, fisheries, and cultural protection were established at both locations and helped inform research and guide research decisions. Our research team recruited three graduate students, two of whom were members of participating Tribes. This funding supported three additional undergraduate students and one additional PhD student during the grant period.  Our research team conducted surveys and interviews, took field trips, and examined documents with Nez Perce and Pyramid Lake Paiute community members, in order to understand space, time and water quality. We used these data to identify trends, or themes, linking space, time and water quality. For example, we created a geographical information system (GIS) with survey and interview data from Nez Perce community members, illustrating 141 areas of water quality importance as identified by tribal community members, alongside reasons these sites were selected. When we closely examined comments related to fish/fisheries (the most referenced concern for water quality) and climate change (a noted significant threat) we found that conceptions of space and time emphasized connection, perpetuation, movement, and reciprocity, which were not always aligned with other governing entities. Likewise, by analyzing data from surveys, field trips, and historical documents of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, our research team identified a core value of the Tribe as ""No matter how hard the struggle is, water must be protected to ensure the continuity of tribal culture, fish, and the water itself."" Central to that core value was that the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe lives and governs in support of a deep, terminal, desert lake and its fish, and the recognition that living and governing was intricately linked to others involved in dynamic conditions of the river basin.  We culminated the work of this project with an online symposium that highlights water quality governance issues of 6 Tribes and 19 presenters across the United States (https://tribalwater.nkn.uidaho.edu/). This research also supported the development of three peer-reviewed publications, a story map, a whitepaper, and a GIS featuring areas of water quality importance to Nez Perce community members.  In this research, looking closely at when and where revealed not just significant water quality concerns expressed by Tribes, but also the continuous work by Tribes to assert sovereignty of time and place in governance of Tribal waters.

"The project will examine learning in eighth grade mathematics with a specific focus on students' learning of reasoning and proof. The intervention builds on a prior study in algebra that demonstrated increases in students' knowledge of argumentation and their performance on mathematics assessments.  This project will extend the use of the argumentation intervention into all eighth grade content areas. The investigators will also address support for teachers in the form of teacher materials that link the argumentation content with mathematics standards and state-wide assessments, and a learning progression to engage students in proving tasks. The project will use assessments of mathematics learning and additional data from teachers and students to understand the impact of the argumentation intervention on teachers and students. The project contributes to understanding how students can learn about mathematical practices, such as proving, that can help them learn mathematics better. A significant contribution will be the definition of aspects of proving and descriptions of student outcomes that can be used to measure how well students have achieved these components of proving. The Discovery Research PreK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project is also supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. <br/><br/>The project suggests twelve conceptual pillars that are combined with classroom processes and assessable outcomes to examine the use of argumentation practices in the teaching of eighth grade mathematics content. The investigation of classroom support for argumentation includes research questions that focus on improvement on state-level assessments, students' ability to construct mathematical arguments, and the conceptual progression that supports students' understanding of argumentation and proof. In addition, the study will examine teachers' role in argumentation in the classroom and their perception of potential challenges for classroom implementation. The study will use an experimental design to examine an intervention for mathematical reasoning and proof in eighth grade.

Despite calls of this kind from national and international organizations to emphasize proof and viable argumentation in mathematics at all grade levels, the teaching of viable argument outside of high school geometry remains meager. The LLAMA project investigated what it would look like to take these calls seriously, by having students learn to make viable arguments for mathematical claims throughout their entire 8th-grade year.  Two cohorts of 8th-grade teachers from Washington, Idaho, and Montana each participated in two years of extensive training and support in the LLAMA model; this included a two-week workshop, ongoing professional development sessions, and continual academic-year coaching support and classroom visits. The 46 teachers were provided with and trained to teach a full year’s worth of lessons developed to teach LLAMA’s 12 conceptual pillars of viable argumentation. These conceptual pillars provided a learning progression through which LLAMA teachers and their students learned to make existence and general claims, develop skepticism of empirical reasoning, and to create a variety of direct and indirect arguments for general claims using our overarching framework of eliminating counterexamples.     To study the effects of the LLAMA intervention, we administered the Student Argument and Reasoning Assessment (SARA) in classrooms as a pre- and post-test to measure the improvement in students’ viable argumentation over the course of Grade 8. We found strong statistically-significant differences between the gains of students in LLAMA classrooms and those of students in non-LLAMA classrooms both during the original study in the first two years of the grant and again in the replication study in years 3 and 4. In general these gains in viable argumentation experienced by LLAMA students had no overall significant effect on student achievement, as measured by the standardized SBAC; however, the LLAMA students significantly outperformed the non-LLAMA students for SBAC Claim 1 (i.e., concepts and procedures) during one year of the study and in another year of the study for SBAC Claim 3 (i.e., communicating reasoning.)  There are few research studies on classroom-based interventions for developing proof and argumentation skills, and we know of none investigating how such skills develop alongside content learning in Grade 8, aside from the LAMP pilot study to LLAMA. LLAMA’s intellectual merit is reflected by how the project has filled this gap, through creating and studying the effects of implementing an innovative learning progression at a large scale across geographically and demographically diverse populations. Broader impact is reflected by the detailed evidence-based account and full materials the LLAMA project has provided for how to develop viable argumentation in Grade 8 classrooms to meet the Common Core.

"Despite a rapid increase in citizen-acquired environmental observations (e.g., citizen science) no cohesive set of best practices or corresponding theories exists for building a broad science of Community-Based Observing (CBO). Current terms and meanings concerning community-based observing networks, community based monitoring, citizen science, and community observer blogs activities are often used interchangeably. Each, however, constitutes a different type of effort along a CBO continuum. By clearly defining what these activities are and what information they can contribute we can better help communities adapt to changing environmental conditions. The EyesNorth Research Coordinating Network (RCN) will involve a range of practitioners, from Native communities to federal agencies, to develop both a science and practice of CBO that will provide the critical connection between observing change and community preparedness and response. The EyesNorth RCN will coordinate activities around training and education-outreach programs among partners to generate and communicate the best practices for adoption across diverse monitoring activities. <br/><br/> The EyesNorth RCN seeks to develop a science of Community-Based Observing leveraging core theories in resilience and adaptation science. It has four objectives that are co-developed with a range of partners from across the circumpolar North countries including Canada, Russia, the United States, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Greenland. The network objective will achieve coordination across activities and organizations currently utilizing CBO for monitoring socio-environmental change in the Arctic and Subarctic. It will create a diverse, transdisciplinary network of users, scientists, and practitioners. The science objective will advance theory to build a science of CBO by developing new and refining existing theoretical connections among disciplines that drive the science of CBO in order to expand and enhance the transferability of adaptation actions by communities on the ground. The sustainability objective will define best practices across the CBO continuum including international data sharing protocols and protections that ensure Indigenous Knowledge and Local Place Based Knowledge are appropriately applied and determined by communities themselves. The education and training objective will ensure that best practices are co-developed rather than imposed and, through partnerships with communities from the Western United States, we will ensure transferability of lessons learned. These partnerships will: a) co-define a range of technology-enabled approaches that enable linked, scalable, and usable data for a range of end-users that will help inform management decisions whose actions affect the resilience of local communities ? where ?data? refers to the breadth of information about the world we live in; and b) transfer these approaches to produce practices that can be applied nationally and internationally. We will develop data and metadata standards necessary to facilitate the sharing of knowledge between researchers and communities which can serve as baselines for future CBO programs while also expanding the scope of current efforts so as to transfer and implement CBO in diverse communities and settings in the Western U.S. We engage with Industry, research and resource management practitioners about the types of data acquisition technologies most amenable to different types of CBO. Ultimately, the EyesNorth RCN will coalesce, for the first time, a broad range of CBO practitioners to design and leverage collaborative and equitable training and education activities with partners in the Arctic and Western U.S. yielding a science of CBO that can enhance the well-being and quality of life for all Americans.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,"47.050, 47.078",QWYKRJH5NNJ3,499090.00,499090,4900,AON-Arctic Observing Network,1642847,,Lilian Alessa,,,US,ID00,University of Idaho,ID,838443020,alessa@uidaho.edu,Lilian,Alessa,robdelga@nsf.gov,Roberto Delgado,7032922397,['0100XXXXDB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],08/22/2016,09/01/2016,08/31/2022,RCN: EyesNorth - A Research Coordination Network of Community-Based Observing Initiatives in the Arctic and Beyond,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Peter L Pulsifer', 'Sandra M Starkweather', 'David L Griffith']",,"['Regional Environmental Change~2018~18~Williams, Paula and Alessa, Lilian and Abatzoglou, John T. and Kliskey, Andrew and Witmer, Frank and Lee, Olivia and Trammell, Jamie and Beaujean, Grace and Venema, Rieken~10.1007/s10113-017-1220-7~~~~~Community-based observing networks and systems in the Arctic: Human perceptions of environmental change and instrument-derived data~~547 to 559~10065494~10065494~OSTI~2023-05-02 00:44:02.423~', 'Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment~2018~16~Griffith, David L. and Alessa, Lilian and Kliskey, Andrew~10.1002/fee.1798~~~~~Community-based observing for social-ecological science: lessons from the Arctic~~p.

EyesNorth  represents new partnerships among a community of practice that comprises scientists, managers, law enforcement officers, and national security specialists from local, tribal, state and federal governments. The project coordinated the knowledge and experience of those professionals to develop, document, and share a set of best practices for community-based observing approaches. Community-based observing is a little like citizen science but relies on experienced and reliable community members and professionals who have lived or worked in a place and built up a keen awareness of that place.  In the EyesNorth project best practices for community-based observing was centered around environmental security including cultural, food, water, livelihoods and sense of safety. To generate the knowledge on security from the community of practice a series of facilitated workshops were organized and run. Each workshop was focused on a specific topic, e.g., Arctic maritime safety and security. Workshop participants then undertook a series of group exercises to list, map, and rank key characteristics, opportunities and threats concerning the topic. The approach relies on the importance of listening to and incorporating multiple and diverse perspectives from participants. This requires the need to be adaptive to constantly changing circumstances and ideas.  One of the most significant outcomes from EyesNorth was an international workshop co-hosted with the NATO Multinational Capability Development Campaign (MCDC) to develop best practices concerning arctic security threats and needs and the role of community-based observing to support these. This workshop produced an international operational science &amp; technology framework for climate security focused on the Arctic. In turn there has been wide sharing of best practices and other results with local, state, tribal, territorial, and federal partners leading to considerable enthusiasm to develop or get involved in observing programs. Results and outcomes are leading to pilot community-based observing programs including the Arctic Scouts in North America and the Goenlandvogstern observing network in Greenland.

"Although plate tectonics provides a first-order explanation of the origin of mountain belts, the tectonic processes that drive surface the uplift and exhumation of mountain belts are not well understood. Even less well understood are the interactions of between uplift, erosional processes, and climate that shape the mountain landscape. This project uses state-of-the art to examine the interaction of tectonics, erosion, and climate in the Peruvian Andes to test new and controversial ideas concerning the uplift of the Andes. The project advances desired societal outcomes through: (1) full participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM through support of an female researchers and students plus outreach programs to high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities; (2) increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with STEM through participation of outreach programs that provide research experiences for high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities ; (3) development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through undergraduate and graduate student training and support of several early career researchers; and (4) increased partnerships through international collaboration. The Division of Earth Sciences Tectonics and Geomorphology &amp; Land Use Dynamics Programs and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering supported this project.<br/><br/>Earth's surface topography responds directly to mantle processes and plate tectonics, controls surface drainage and sediment transport patterns, and influences atmospheric circulation and climate. As the type example of ocean-continent subduction-generated high topography, the Central Andes are critical to evaluating geodynamic models of orogenesis. Although previous studies of the structural history, past elevations, and incision record have provided important insights on surface uplift, these studies also suggest a disparate range of uplift histories and associated tectonic drivers. Current geodynamic models for Andean orogenesis include: (1) continuous late Cenozoic crustal thickening and shortening, resulting in gradual surface uplift and canyon incision; (2) late Cenozoic delamination of South American lithosphere, resulting in rapid surface uplift and a late Miocene pulse of incision; and (3) early Cenozoic contraction-driven crustal thickening, resulting in near modern elevations in the west by late Eocene and propagating deformation eastward through the Cenozoic. To distinguish between models, this project uses: (1) stable isotope analyses of volcanic glasses and soil carbonates to provide quantitative estimates of paleoelevations over time, coupled with geochronology to constrain timing; (2) isotope-enabled general circulation modeling to determine how changing elevations affected climate and to quantitatively interpret stable isotope data, constrained by modern elevation-isotope and climate-isotope relationships; (3) data-validated fluvial erosion modeling to predict the erosional response to different models; and (4) fluvial and lacustrine sedimentology and sediment provenance to identify changes in drainage system extent and basin development.

The Western Cordillera is a mountain belt containing active volcanoes resulting from subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate (Figure 1). The Western Cordillera is separated from the Eastern Cordillera mountains by the Altiplano: a high elevation, internally drained plateau.  The hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions (typically reported as &delta;D and &delta;18O values) of ancient water are commonly used to determine past elevations because in many regions these values decrease substantially with increasing elevation. The first component of this study was to investigate the modern relationship between isotopic values of precipitation and soil waters and elevation in this region. We focused on soil water in addition to precipitation because it provides an approximation of the average isotopic composition of rainfall. We sampled rainfall from across the Andes by developing an observational network that relied on the assistance of local people. We also excavated soil pits (Figure 2) to collect soil samples for measurement of soil water &delta;D/&delta;18O values. These samples provided data on the modern climate.  The second component of this study was to investigate elevation and climate change across the Andes in the past. We collected samples of deposits from explosive volcanic eruptions (ignimbrites, Figure 3). We compared the &delta;D values of water preserved in volcanic glass from these samples to our modern data to determine how the elevation and shape of the range has changed over time. Our sampling allowed us to reconstruct profiles of &delta;D values across the Andes extending back 25 million years.  The modern profile of the Andes exhibits large variations in &delta;D and &delta;18O values in soil water and precipitation. The region between the Pacific coast and crest of the Western Cordillera is exceptionally dry and is associated with high &delta;D and &delta;18O values. These values decrease abruptly near the crest of the Western Cordillera, remain low, but variable, across the Altiplano, and increase down the eastern flank of the Eastern Cordillera.  Moisture from the Pacific Ocean is almost entirely recycled as it moves across the hyperarid southwest region towards the Western Cordillera crest (Figure 4). Some of this recycled Pacific moisture is funneled up large, westward-draining canyons and reaches the Western Cordillera crest where it mixes with Amazonian moisture (Figure 5). The abrupt change in values at the crest likely represents the mixing between air masses. Moisture from the Amazon is carried over the Eastern Cordillera and across the Altiplano but does not cross the Western Cordillera crest.  The alignment of the highest topography with this moisture-source divide suggests that we can identify where the highest topography was in the past using the &delta;D values recorded by volcanic glass. Our results suggest that 16 million years ago the crest of the Western Cordillera was 100 km further inland from the Pacific than it is today. The migration of the crest to its current position occurred within a few million years.  To interpret the environmental meaning of the isotopic values, we also conducted paleoclimate simulations with water isotope tracking using the NCAR Community Earth System Model. These simulations confirmed that the &delta;D values that we observed could only be explained by the presence of high topography. Further, these simulations tell a story about the evolution of South American environments, including the Amazon rainforest, as the South American continent rifted from Africa and the Andes formed.  To complement the isotopic record of elevation changes, we also explored the erosional history of rivers in southwest Peru. When land masses are elevated by tectonic processes, rivers incise into the elevated topography, potentially leaving a record of past tectonic uplift. We mapped locations where the rivers deviated from the typical pattern of decreasing slope with distance downstream to reconstruct the pre-incision level of the river path. We combined these metrics with rates of erosion using cosmogenic radionuclides to reconstruct the timing and magnitude of recent uplift in the area. Results show that the most recent pulse of incision (and tectonic uplift) varied from 100?s of meters of incision in the last 5 million years in the southeastern part of the study area to &gt;1 kilometer in the northwest. We attribute the spatial variation to crustal processes associated with the subducting Nazca ridge at the northwest corner of the study area.  This work involved three graduate students, one postdoc, and three undergraduates, who all received advanced training that will support their career goals. We also shared our findings, including how mountain belts influence climate and the fundamentals of field-based investigations, to 18 University of Texas undergraduates on a week-long field trip across the region (Figure 6).

"Forests store the most carbon of any terrestrial ecosystem and capture ~20% of U.S. fossil fuel emissions annually through uptake of carbon dioxide. Drought and wildfire caused by changing precipitation patterns, increased temperatures, increased fuel loads, and decades of fire suppression are reducing forest carbon uptake from local to continental scales.  This trend is especially widespread in Idaho and the intermountain west and has important implications for climate change and forest management options. Given the key role of forests in climate regulation, understanding forest responses to disturbance and the feedbacks to the atmosphere is a key research and policy-relevant priority in the U.S. and elsewhere. As temperature, fire, and precipitation regimes continue to change and influence forest mortality, there is a growing potential role for drought and fire mitigation efforts such as forest thinning. This research will evaluate the climate impacts of restoration thinning, a forest management activity aimed at reducing drought- and fire-related mortality, by combining new experimental plot data and earth system modeling.  This project has three main goals: 1) quantify the spatial and temporal impacts of thinning on net regional greenhouse gas emissions and climate, 2) evaluate the impact of thinning on forest resilience to drought and disturbance, and 3) contribute to education of students and teachers about the role of forests in climate regulation.<br/><br/>By integrating novel, field-based technology, existing datasets, and state-of-the-art earth system modeling, this research will yield scientific insights into both climatic and management controls on tree growth as well as forest-atmosphere gas exchange in the mixed conifer forests of the Rocky Mountains in Idaho. The project objectives will advance the current understanding of how disturbance impacts forest carbon, water, and energy balance at time steps from minutes to years, which is crucial for earth system model development and evaluation. Improved earth system modeling and existing long-term ecological research data will be used to make predictions of forest-atmosphere interactions for the intermountain west over the 21st century. This will improve policy-relevant understanding of forest management practices and forest climate regulation. Additionally, this project will contribute to science education. Students and educators will be actively engaged in climate and forest science research through collection and sharing of data and will learn how forests capture and release carbon dioxide, and how these processes influence climate.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,653194.00,667129,4900,ECOSYSTEM STUDIES,1553049,,Tara Hudiburg,875 Perimeter Drive,Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838441133,thudiburg@uidaho.edu,Tara,Hudiburg,mkane@nsf.gov,Matthew Kane,7032927186,"['01001617DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001718DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001819DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001920DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002021DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",01/29/2016,04/01/2016,12/31/2021,CAREER: Forest-atmosphere interactions in an era of fire and drought,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,"['Ecosphere~2021~12~E.

Drought and wildfire caused by changing precipitation patterns, increased temperatures and fuel loads, and decades of fire suppression are reducing forest carbon uptake from local to continental to global scales. Because forests serve as essential natural climate solutions and are used as carbon offsets for a growing number of governments and companies, understanding the response of forests to drought, fire, and potential management strategies is a key research priority globally. By integrating novel field-based instrumental technology, existing datasets, state-of-the-art Earth system modeling, and an experiential forest-climate interactions education program, this research has yielded insights about forest response to management and climate change while training the next generation of carbon cycle scientists and educators.  Key outcomes of this work include twelve peer-reviewed publications, two MS theses, three PhD dissertations, dozens of conference presentations, training for two postdoctoral researchers, eight undergraduate research experiences, and an education curriculum publicly available for use by all high school teachers. Over half of the trainees were from underrepresented groups. Moreover, our work led to partnerships with national NGO's with whom we have held three bi-partisan climate symposia where regional congresspersons participated in collaborative town hall events to discuss climate change mitigation strategies in the intermountain west. Finally, we have communicated our work at numerous public outreach venues and events, including Earth Day celebrations, science caf?'s, native plant society meetings, land-grant extension workshops, local news outlets, and national public radio.  We have made significant advances of knowledge about how forest thinning affects tree physiological mechanisms, forest ecosystem carbon and water balance, net greenhouse gas balance of forestry operations, and the carbon trade-offs associated with varying levels of thinning, fire, and drought at local-to-regional scales. Most importantly, we found that:   1. Thinning in an experimental Northern Rocky Mountain forest resulted in a 45% decline in stand growth, despite increased individual tree growth. Model simulations revealed a substantial carbon deficit will persist through the mid 21st century, and is overwhelmingly driven by increased emissions from dead biomass pools.  2. Management practices in northern Idaho, which fundamentally differ between public and private lands, overwhelm climate and fire in driving long-term forest carbon dynamics. Planned management on public lands to prevent fire and improve forest health leads to more favorable forest carbon outcomes relative to current practices (i.e. clearcuts).   3. In the western US, forest fire carbon emissions are on average only 6% of anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions over the past decade and fuels reduction strategies that allow harvest of mature trees releases a higher density of carbon emissions (e.g., per unit area) relative to wildfire (150-800%); primarily because harvest causes a higher rate of tree mortality than wildfire.   4. Tree growth sensitivity to climate differs by more than 10% across four tree species in the western US, but depends upon management practices (i.e. thinning) such that future modeled forest carbon stocks are nuanced and may be highly variable across space.    5. The summer 2021 heat dome in the western US led to a 20% reduction in tree water use and wood growth, as well as lower soil carbon emissions in all thinned and unthinned control plots (and age classes) relative to previous years.

"This project seeks to increase resilience to wildfire hazards by modeling and mapping community and ecosystem service vulnerability to wildfire. The hazards of wildfire have increased significantly over time as a function of communities expanding into more rural areas adjacent to the urban interface and the increasing prevalence of conditions for large and rapid wildfire growth. Both initial wildfire events and the post-fire floods and landslides that often follow them are considerable threats to the growing population in fire-prone environments, the infrastructure associated with that populace, and the ecosystem services it relies upon, such as clean water or an economic base such as timber or tourism. However, the manner in which other environmental factors, such as drought and bark beetle outbreaks in forests, contribute to wildfire spread and the potential for post-fire flooding is poorly understood and not currently modeled in an integrated way that supports policy development and community adaptation planning. This project focuses on the Pacific Northwest region to develop a fire component to the existing BioEarth model that will improve our understanding of factors that contribute to wildfires becoming disasters, and prioritizes stakeholder and involvement and public engagement to identify management actions that will increase adaptive capacity and overcome social and political barriers.<br/><br/><br/>Although periodic wildfires are important for a healthy ecosystem, a combination of biophysical and socioeconomic factors can turn a fire into a disaster, with negative impacts in socioecological contexts. These impacts can last for decades, and can include increased vulnerability to subsequent, cascading hazards such as flooding, landslides, and the potential for local to regional economic collapse. Increasing community resilience to these compounding, wildfire-related disasters requires specific attention to social, economic, political, and environmental dynamics at spatial scales ranging from local to national and at temporal scales ranging from minutes to multiple decades. There is a growing understanding of isolated interactions between fire, climate, ecosystem structure and function, forest management activities, and their impacts at multiple scales. The complex and dynamic coupling of these interactions into an integrated human-natural systems model that includes links to policy, resource management, and adaptive capacity, however, is poorly understood. This lack of synthesis limits wildfire resilience in the context of a changing global environment. The overarching goal of this project is to support policy and other decision-making processes at local, regional, and national scales to reduce the risk of wildfire becoming a disaster and increase community and ecological adaptive capacities. This will be done by 1) advancing the understanding of wildfire risk and associated impacts in the context of interactions between regional climate and other forest ecosystem perturbations (e.g., drought in future climates, insect outbreak, and a history of fire management) through new developments in integrated environmental modeling, 2) improving the ability to assess and predict vulnerability and resilience to wildfire using a scalable regional approach, and 3) coordinating with a stakeholder advisory group to develop a decision support system for providing spatially-explicit feasible actions to increase local, regional, and national wildfire resilience.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,"47.049, 47.050",QWYKRJH5NNJ3,2775000.00,2775000,4900,Structural and Architectural E,1520873,,Alistair M Smith,,,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443021,ckolden@ucmerced.edu,Crystal,Kolden,jwang@nsf.gov,Junping Wang,7032924488,"['01001516DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001617DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",07/27/2015,10/01/2015,09/30/2021,Hazards SEES: Advancing Resilience to Compounding Disasters: An Integrated Natural-Human Systems Assessment of Wildfire Vulnerability,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['John Abatzoglou', 'Jeffrey A Hicke', 'Lilian Alessa', 'Jennifer Adam']",M,"['BioScience~2016~66~Smith, AMS, Kolden, CA, Paveglio, T, Cochrane, MA, Mortitz, MA, Bowman, DMJS, Hoffman, CM, Lutz, J, Queen, LP, Hudak, AT, Alessa, L, Kliskey, AD, Goetz, S, Yedinak, KM, Boschetti, L, Higuera, PE, Flannigan, M, Strand, EK, van Wagtendonk, JW Anderson, JW S~doi: 10.1093/biosci/biv182~130~~~~The science of firescapes: achieving fire -resilient communities~~~~~~2016-07-28 16:43:19.150~', 'Remote Sensing~2016~8~Sparks, A.M.S., Kolden, C.A., Talhelm, A.F., Smith, A.M.S., Apostol, K.G., Johnson, D.M., Boschetti, L.~dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs8070572~572~~~~Spectral indices accurately quantify changes in tree physiology following fire: toward mechanistic assessments of landscape post-fire carbon cycling~~~~~~2016-07-28 16:43:19.163~', 'International Journal of Wildland Fire~2016~25~Smith AMS, Sparks AM, Kolden CA, Abatzoglou JT, Talhelm AF, Johnson DM, Boschetti L, Lutz JA, Apostol KG, Yedinak KM, Tinkham WT, Kremens RJ~10.1071/WF15130~158~~~~Towards a new paradigm in fire severity research using dose-response experiments~~~~~~2016-07-28 16:43:19.183~', 'Environmental Research Letters~2016~11~Abatzoglou, J.T., C.A.

Several recent wildfires have caused disasters including the 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise (California), the 2020 Babb Road Fire that destroyed Malden (Washington State), and the 2021-2022 Marshall Fire that destroyed more than a 1000 homes in Louisville and Superior (Colorado). The impact of these wildfire disasters is felt not only in evacuations and loss of homes and businesses, but in the tragic loss of human lives. In 2017, the California fire season led to 43 deaths and an estimated $10 billion in damages. However, the impacts of these wildfires are also felt long after the flames stop. These ?cascading consequences? include chronic health conditions due to poor air quality and the buildup of eroded sediment in rivers and reservoirs that impact water quality and increase slope instability and erosion. The future predictions in this region are for even longer fire seasons with more extreme fires and potentially more cascading consequences and disasters on communities. This project sought to help western United States communities better prepare for future wildfires through three broad goals: (1) improving the ability to model and map wildfire risk and impacts on ecosystems, (2) improving our understanding of the different ways to achieve fire adapted communities that can co-exist with fire, and (3) improving our understanding of what pre-emptive actions can be taken to improve the ability of communities and ecosystems to recover from the impacts of wildfires.     This project team worked with representatives from small towns and large metropolitan cities. The selection of each site started with face-to-face meetings followed by a workshop where project researchers met with local leaders and key decision makers from each community. This allowed key relationships to be established early, simplifying the gathering of relevant data, and enabling continued feedback. The locations included Ketchum Idaho, the Cedar River Watershed near Seattle, and the Portland Water Bureau Bull Run Watershed. Additional communities across California, Washington State, Idaho, and Montana also benefited from the project. One tool advanced by the project team allowed municipal planners in Seattle and Portland to assess how different methods to manage fire affected lands also impacted drinking water supply systems. The project team also helped improve knowledge of how to achieve fire adapted communities. We showed how different communities evolve their views of wildfire risk and the different ways that communities respond to wildfires. One of the major outcomes of the project was informing a range of city planners on planning evacuation routes. We presented a ?blueprint? from which diverse communities can identify the steps they need to take to create a fire adapted community. We also presented a series of engineering and urban planning ideas on how communities can reduce risks of future fires and better co-exist with fires that occur, such as building subterranean shelters and burying power lines. The team also improved knowledge of how climate change, fire spread, and the impacts on forests from insects and fires were described within decision support tools. As part of this, the team started a new research area bridging the disciplines of plant physiology and fire behavior that we called pyroecophysiology. This research area explores how known amounts of heat from fire impacts tree growth and death. The team looked at 5 tree species important to the northwestern United States timber industry. As forest managers regularly use planned fires to reduce the future impact of uncontrollable wildfires, this information is useful as it tells them how much fire they can use without killing key timber species and allows them to get improved estimates of costs associated with salvage logging and replanting.     The broader impacts of our research included over 100 publications and completing the education of over 20 master?s students and 7 doctoral students. The team also organized a workshop that brought together several international fire scientists. An outcome of this workshop was the recognition that a barrier to learning from past extreme wildfires was that there was no place to publish data about these fires. Workshop participants also observed that most journals wouldn?t publish papers about methods, models, or data. To address these needs, this workshop directly led to a new international science journal, called Fire. Although Fire only started in 2018, the journal has already been recognized as being in the top 20 percent of all internationally respected forestry journals. A key outcome of the project team via the journal Fire has been to improve recognition of women and other diverse leaders in fire science. In 2021, Fire became one of only a few scientific journals to require authors to demonstrate that they have permission from indigenous communities prior to publishing data derived from their land.

It is a region of irreplaceable cultural and biological diversity. It is also a region under pressure from development, mineral extraction and water contamination, urbanization and economic disparity.     Between 2016-2020, University of Idaho (UI) faculty, undergraduate and graduate students worked with local Ecuadorian students and faculty to assess the local perceptions and ecological health of the terrestrial and aquatic systems around the Southern Ecuadorian city of Loja. Loja is a vibrant, midsized city, located in a mountain valley, a short distance from the Amazon basin to the East and the dry forest coast to the West. Loja is bisected by two rivers- the Zamorra and the Malacatos- that join at the South end of the city- and the local people are completely dependent on the health of the regional watershed.     As part of a collaboration between the UI and the Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja (UTPL), teams of 4-6 students from the United States spent two months a summer between 2016 and 2019 conducting social science and ecological research in the Loja watershed, as well as in a nearby dry forest on the Peruvian border.  We wanted to better understand how different land use patterns impact ecosystem integrity and biodiversity.  Some students focused on water quality and sampled streams in protected forests, agricultural fields and urban corridors, assessing various indices of water quality and contamination. The complex biota on a river rock (known as periphyton) can yield complex information on stream degradation, as can levels of phosphorus or dissolved nitrogen. Other students surveyed for aquatic insects, terrestrial insects, freshwater mussels, amphibians, birds and bats.      While one group of students was addressing ecological questions, another group was evaluating attitudes of local stakeholders towards the water in and around Loja. Almost everyone in Loja uses the Zamorra and Malacatos rivers for washing clothes, for children?s playtime, for recreating at the local park, for household use in peripheral communities and sometimes for waste disposal or other less benign uses. We wanted to know how people in Loja perceived their rivers. Have they noted declines in water quality? Were they concerned about large-scale impacts (like mining or climate change) or about the consequences of their own activities?     Over a four-year period, our team of student researchers addressed these questions using multiple approaches. They traveled to households all around Loja and interviewed local citizens- sometimes in the heart of the city, sometimes in remote homesteads. They conducted group workshops, engaged in a process called participatory mapping, and distributed surveys. In the process, they generated work that was tangential but fun, like an educational coloring book on water systems for the local schools in Loja.     Predictably, we discovered that the interaction between ecological and social systems is complicated. The creatures of stream, field and forest near Loja, Ecuador are definitely impacted by urbanization and declines in water quality, but not always at the same rate. Rather than favoring pristine habitats, some organisms (certain aquatic insects, for example, or the microscopic periphyton that live on rocks) may thrive in pastures or urban streams. However, the overall trend is that increasing urbanization leads to declines in biodiversity.     Similarly, social attitudes are complex. Citizens in Loja, whether urban or rural, are often very aware of some impacts to their water systems (such as runoff from mines or urban roads), but they often see these impacts as things that originate somewhere else such as upstream, or in an industry that is several steps removed from their own lives.     Students in our program faced a number of challenges (road wash-outs, torrential downpours, midges, local suspicion in the face of interviews), but also experienced unique experiences- such as the identification of a new species, the Lojano frog Pristimantis lojanus, indigenous meals in rural farmsteads, and the comradery and cultural exchange with new colleagues at the Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja. Their efforts have yielded three peer reviewed publications with more to come. Thirteen of the 19 student participants in our program are currently involved in active ecological research or graduate school.     In the last year of the project, we shifted our focus to studying bats on the Galapagos Islands and funded a PhD student who worked on bats in Loja as an undergraduate student in our program. This project also provided the first opportunity for a local Ecuadorian faculty member to visit the Galapagos Islands and conduct research there.     It has never been more important to make wise decisions on land use and water stewardship. We hope that our work in the Loja watershed and the Galapagos Islands will make an ongoing contribution towards these decisions.

"Fluid circulation through the oceanic crust at the axis of mid-ocean ridges is a primary mechanism through which the Earth loses its internal heat. At the seafloor, this circulation releases hot fluids into the deep ocean. These hydrothermal sites typically host ecosystems and life forms found nowhere else on the planet and are thought to be one of the places on Earth where life may have originated. Hydrothermal fluid venting often occurs at or near major fault or fracture zones, suggesting that these breaks in the ocean crust can act as highly permeable conduits for fluids escape. It is unclear, however, to what extent these breaks in Earth's crust enable fluids to enter and move downward into the seafloor where they get heated. This research uses analog experiments, using a 3-D printer, and modeling to explore how fluid circulation at mid-ocean ridges spontaneously organizes itself and transports heat in highly fractured and faulted crust. By allowing exploration of the relation between venting sites and major tectonic features, the research facilitates our understanding of geothermal processes and the search for new hydrothermal sites on the seafloor.  Broader impacts of the work include integration of research and education and support of three early career investigators, one from an institution in an EPSCoR state (Idaho).  Results have applications ranging from terrestrial groundwater hydrology to geothermal energy, carbon sequestration, and the oil industry.<br/><br/>This research employs numerical and analog experiments to describe and quantitatively explain the effect of heterogeneous permeability on subsurface flow geometry and heat extraction. Using a 3-D printer, we will generate plastic analogs of oceanic crust, containing a series of regularly spaced tubes that will act as fluid pathways of defined permeability. Within this permeable matrix, a planar slot of prescribed width, inclination, and greater permeability (achieved through wider tubes) will be created, representing the damage zone that typically surrounds active faults. The printed volume will be placed in a glass-walled tank containing a mixture of glucose and water. The fluid will be heated from below to initiate porous convection. A combination of particle image velocimetry, thermo-chromic liquid crystals, and temperature sensors at the top and bottom of the volume will allow quantification of the locations of fluid recharge and discharge and the heat output of the convective system as the permeability contrast and geometry of the slot is varied.  Results will be compared to numerical models of porous convection in heterogeneous media and then extrapolated to natural conditions. The research will focus on predicting the conditions under which high-permeability fault zones can trap and focus hydrothermal convection rolls. The combined experimental and theoretical approach will greatly inform the investigation of targeted hydrothermal sites on slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges that sit next to major fault systems or near major crustal heterogeneities.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,68238.00,68238,4900,Marine Geology and Geophysics,1537650,,Eric L Mittelstaedt,875 Perimeter Dr. MS3022,Moscow,US,ID00,University of Idaho,ID,838443020,emittelstaedt@uidaho.edu,Eric,Mittelstaedt,,Deborah K.

These high temperature fluids modify the long-term chemistry of the oceans, account for a large fraction of the cooling of our planet, and form important mineral deposits. However, it is not well understood what controls the locations of hydrothermal vents and the spacing between them. For instance, some groups of vents appear to be regularly spaced, but others lack a systematic pattern. One likely control on vent location is the physical structure of the oceanic crust. For example, many hydrothermal vents are found near exposed faults on the seafloor. It is possible that faults may alter the route high-temperature fluids take as they rise toward the surface because movement on faults (e.g. during earthquakes) causes rocks around the fault to break, opening gaps and spaces that are easier for fluids to pass through than the small pores in unbroken rock. Faults at mid-ocean ridges are commonly observed to dip downward at an angle of about 60? and to be approximately planar. Thus, fluids rising from beneath a fault encounter the broken-up rocks and sometimes move up along the fault dip, rather than rising vertically through unbroken rock. This study aimed to quantify the extent to which broken-up rocks around faults alter the paths that high-temperature fluids take on their way to the surface. By understanding the role faults play in controlling the location of hydrothermal vents, we can use observations of hydrothermal vent locations to tell us about the structure of the crust.   To investigate how faults alter hydrothermal vent locations, we used laboratory experiments and numerical simulations of fluid circulation through the broken rocks around a single fault located above a heat source within an otherwise uniform crust. Results indicate that faults will change the location of hydrothermal venting if two conditions are true. First, the overall rate fluids rise through the unbroken oceanic crust must be relatively slow; if fluids can rise too easily through the crust, they will pass through the broken-up fault zone rocks and rise vertically to the surface. Second, it must be at least several times easier for fluids to pass through broken-up fault zone rocks than to pass through unbroken crust. The balance between how easy it is to pass through fault zone rocks relative to unbroken crust determines how far fluids will rise along the fault dip before entering the overlying unbroken rock.  If it takes a long time for fluids to rise through unbroken crust they will remain trapped in the fault zone and discharge from the seafloor at the fault.  In contrast, if it is very easy to pass through the unbroken crustal rock, the fluids will rise through the fault zone for a short time, but quickly enter the unbroken rock above the fault, discharging at the seafloor above the heat source that drives fluid circulation.   The broken-up rock around faults may also alter the spacing of hydrothermal systems along a mid-ocean ridge.  In experiments both with and without a fault, we find the spacing between fluid discharge zones depends on temperature of the heating element at the base of the tank and the ease with which fluids can rise through the system. Similar to previous studies, we found that increasing the heating element temperature and the size of pores within the material (making it easier for fluid to rise) leads to more closely spaced plumes. However, in cases with a fault, the spacing of fluid discharge was ~3 times larger than for a similar case without a fault, suggesting that fault zones may increase the expected plume spacing.  The above results allow us to use observations of hydrothermal vent locations and fault characteristics to better understand the properties of the oceanic crust. For example, the ease with which fluids pass through the crust (i.e., the permeability) is one of the most poorly known, yet important properties of the ocean crust for understanding hydrothermal venting; our results can place bounds on this value for some vents.  Moreover, by examining the locations of hydrothermal systems relative to faults, we can infer the locations of heat sources, such as magma chambers. Overall, the results of this study provide important information about how faults can control the circulation of high-temperature fluids and how the locations of hydrothermal vents can provide constraints on the structure of the oceanic crust.

"1500815<br/>Srivastava<br/>University of Idaho<br/><br/>Rare earth elements (REE) are considered critical materials because of their essential usage in a variety of business sectors and their potential for supply shortages and scarcity. Recovery of REE from waste streams and end-of-life products is an attractive technology, however separation of REE from these materials can be costly and involve toxic and hazardous chemicals.

Development of a rapid screen tool which identifies organisms which show enhanced accumulation behavior would exceed existing cell separation technologies, such as flow cytometry, as these technologies rely upon physical differences (size, shape) or labeling populations with fluorescent tags to perform selective separation, any of which are unsuitable (as for morphology changes) or unavailable (tagging) for OHMs. The novel and potentially transformative electrokinetic separation technique developed in this research relies on intrinsic alternations in dielectric properties produced by OHMs. The results indicate a higher degree of difference in membrane proprties between native and metal adsorbed OHMs indicating this to be a surface phenomena. The metals might have abbsorbed into the cytoplasm, however, there is no difference in properties observed between them. This technology was adapted using only one OHM, C. Necator and a combination of three different REEs- Samaraium, Neodymium, and Europium (Fig. 1). The simulation studies conducted also indicate that native and metal adsorbed OHMs can be sorted on a microfluidic platform. The whole platform is ~ 1 cm in length and can be run on battery power to achieve sorting.   The amount of REE adsorbed was quantified by measuring the properties of the membrane via dielectrophoresis. This quantification protocol was validated utilizing UV-Vis instead of ICP-MS as proposed in the proposal. This is a cost-effective alternative approach which was evaluated statistically through t-test and the data generated was significant.  Additionally, the simple, portable operation and small size of these devices enables the ability to bundle high-density microdevices for scalable, massive parallel or sequential processing, making this technology even more attractive.

"The development of a new instrument for simultaneous assessment of brain, muscular, and nervous system output during functional arm and hand tasks will provide unprecedented insight into the inner workings of arm and hand function, including movement intention and movement performance. The developed BiLateral Upper-extremity Exoskeleton for Simultaneous Assessment of Biomechanical and Neuromuscular Output (BLUE SABINO) would be the first of its kind with the ability to record extensive metrics from both left and right hemispheres of the brain, muscle activation patterns, and movement of both left and right arms simultaneously. Particularly evident in populations with neuromuscular impairment, there is a gap in our current knowledge between the action potentials generated by the brain and the resulting movements generated by the muscles. This Major Research Instrumentation award will address this gap by facilitating a better understanding of arm function along the full neuromuscular pathway from thought to action. BLUE SABINO will also enable further study on a variety of cutting-edge research areas from brain-computer-interfaces and virtual environment simulation to advanced control of industrial and medical robotics. <br/><br/>BLUE SABINO will combine the mechanical precision and repeatability of a 28 degree-of-freedom (DOF) dual-arm exoskeleton, with existing high-end acquisition systems for collecting electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) data from the brain and neuromuscular system, as well as processing algorithms to compute general assessment metrics. The exoskeleton components will allow natural reach and grasp movements through two 14-DOF (12 active, 2 passive) wearable arms. EEG and EMG acquisition will be performed with at least 32 and 64 channels, respectively, per side. Together, the instrument will provide a groundbreaking, holistic instrument for quantitative assessment and evaluation of arm function not currently possible. Acquisition of biometric data from both left and right sides of the body will allow evaluation of unilateral and bimanual activities of daily living (ADL), as well as a means of monitoring and evaluating task performance for both healthy and impaired users. The comprehensive assessment capacity will enable transformative research across a wide spectrum of domains including: functional outcome assessment, computation and planning of targeted therapeutic approaches, advanced therapy/response correlations, novel brain-machine-body rehabilitation paradigms, and development and optimization of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and brain-controlled neuroprosthetics.<br/><br/>This award is supported by the Engineering Directorate's Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) Division along with the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) Division.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,1084787.00,1288496,4900,Major Research Instrumentation,1532239,,Joel Perry,"875 Perimeter Drive, MS 0902",Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838440902,jperry@uidaho.edu,Joel,Perry,aleoness@nsf.gov,Alex Leonessa,7032922633,"['01001516DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",08/23/2015,09/01/2015,08/31/2023,"MRI: Development of an exoskeleton for simultaneous assessment of brain, muscular, and nervous system output during functional arm and hand tasks",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Eric T Wolbrecht'],,"['Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation~2023~~Rene M.

Position, length, and height adjustments have been designed to fit individuals from the 5th percentile female to the 95th percentile male, ensuring usability with a wide range of the adult population. The BLUE SABINO acronym stands for BiLateral Upper-limb Exoskeleton for Simultaneous Assessment of Biomechanical and Neuromuscular Output, where each term conveys core components of instrument functionality.     BLUE: The bilateral upper-limb systemhas both left and right arms thatallow assessment of one or both upper extremities. In the 14-jointconfiguration (Figure 3-A), eacharm iscomposed of 7actuated joints that align with anatomical axes of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Twelve additional actuated joints can be added via two (left and right) three-fingered hand modules (Figure 3-B) to assess combined arm and hand function during reach and grasp tasks. Each hand module is composed of 6 actuated joints that support flexion and extension movements of the thumb, index finger, and combined middle-ring-pinky fingers, as well as abduction and adduction of the thumb,allowingat least 8 different common grasp types (Figure 3-C) and a 94% success score from a standardized grasping assessment test (Figure 3-D). Two additional joints can be added to each shoulder via a module called PRISM (Figure 3-E). PRISM has been partially fabricated and, once complete, will allow assessment of shoulder translation movements such as shoulder shrugs and abnormal arm compensation strategies commonly employed by individuals with impairment. As an exoskeleton system, robotic joint axes align with human joint axes.Thisallowsassessment of individual joints along the length of the arm, and the use of safety systems inboth hardware and softwaretoprevent unwanted positions, speeds, forces, and torques at the joint level (Figure 4-A). Manual safety includes e-stops for the subject and the administrator, and a foot-operated enable switch for the subject (Figure 4-B). Only whenthe foot-operated switch is pressed (enabled) will themotor drivers send torque commands, calculated in thecontrol loop (Figure 4-C),to the joint motors.      SABINO: As an instrument for collecting data on biomechanical and neuromuscular output, the system uses an array of high-resolution sensors that measure movement of individual joints (+/- 0.003 degrees), interaction forces (+/- 0.02 N),interaction torques (+/- 0.005 Nm), and abiosignal amplifier with up to 256 channels of electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals from the muscles and brain (Figure 5).Biomechanical and neuromuscular data are collected for simultaneous assessment using a real-time control system communicating via EtherCAT with actuators and sensors one thousand times per second, and through theuse of a dedicated microcontroller for signal synchronization between the biosignal amplifier and a real-time target PC.Combined, the system allows position- and force-based control of actuators, and the capability to deliver both prescribed movements and free movement of the arm and hand during completion of active (subject-driven) or passive (robot-driven) tasks.     As a result, the novel robotic system (Figure 6) is well suited for functional data collection of the arm and hand during a variety of activities of daily living in bothnormal and impaired populations. Activities that require active movement by the subjects use high-sensitivity force/torque sensors as control inputs to a force-based admittance controller that moves highly-geared but backdrivable motors. Activities that require the subject to be passive use a force- and position-based impedance controller to move the robot joints through desired trajectories orposes while observing safe position and torque limits. The array of tasks that can be measured by the 14-joint arm system of Figure 6-Aand the 6-joint hand module of Figure 6-B issignificant and will be further expanded with the addition of the PRISM shoulder module.Combined with the ability to simultaneously measure neurological signals from the body, the BLUE SABINO instrument will be a valuable research tool to quantitatively explore function, impairment, and trainingin the upper extremities.

"Forest trees provide a wide range of traditional and advanced renewable materials including wood, paper, power, composites, polymers, and liquid fuels. Demand for these products is increasing due to population growth, increasing standards of living, and an increased recognition that forests will produce these products indefinitely if managers maintain the quality of soil in which trees are grown. Yet at as demand for renewable wood-based products increases, the commercial forest land base is shrinking.  Meeting increased demands for raw wood products from a shrinking land base requires increased production capacity through advanced forestry practices.  There is an important opportunity in the Inland Northwest (INW) where both the level of past investments and environmental constraints have limited gains in silvicultural systems. University of Idaho has joined nine other universities in the Center for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS) with the objective of educating a diversity of students to improve the productive capacity of our forests and meet societies increasing demand for future green, renewable products.<br/><br/>Cooperative research links forest managers with universities to address a wide range of genetic and cultural problems.  INW forest land managers are faced with numerous questions about constrains on forest productivity and the productive capacity of our forests under intense management regimes.  The University of Idaho is uniquely situated in the region to address those questions in a rigorous and efficient manner.  Such collaborative research programs solve problems that are most relevant to local land managers.  Continued advancement requires work at the molecular to the ecosystems scales, and over an equally broad range of time scales considering the longevity of forest stand development.  CAFS allows regional cooperative research programs to take advantage of progress made nationally to collectively advance forestry systems nationwide.  Research will focus on increasing the carrying capacity of INW forests by studying the constraints to growth at high density and developing improved varieties for commercial reforestation. Recent advances in genomics may significantly shorten the tree breeding cycle allowing forest managers to apply genetic improvements to commercial forests much more quickly than previously possible.

Research conducted by CAFS increases the competitiveness of forest products industries and forest landowners by solving problems that transcend traditional species, regional, and disciplinary boundaries.  At University of Idaho we focused on developing genetic markers for western white pine and Douglas-fir, evaluate thinning responses, developing effective maximum stand density models, realizing productivity potential of select western larch genotypes, and identifying endophytes that are effective at improving disease resistance.   We have identified numerous indicator genes for Douglas-fir and western white pine in collaboration with Oregon State University. We will link markers for these genes in both species to growth and disease resistance traits of interest to tree breeders. These gene markers are used to track family lineage and to select trees with superior genotypes using genetic testing and analysis procedures.  The response of growth resources to thinning at numerous precommercial sites indicates that thinning increased soil resources and improved light availability.  Soil N increased by 55-70%, soil moisture increased by 60-75%, whereas Light increased by 30 to 50 percent.  The best tree growth response to thinning occurred at locations with high resources compared with low resources and where stand density was higher prior to thinning.  Such information demonstrated the value of thinning to improve productivity and health of forests and demonstrates how management operations improve the resilience of forests to environmental stress.  Models of stand carrying capacity or maximum stand density were developed based on geographic, climate and soil information.  These models allowed development of maps that forest land managers can use to determine the stage of stand development relative to a site?s carrying capacity (Figure 1).  These models are being applied by foresters to determine management operations such as species composition, planting densities, and for scheduling thinning and harvest operations.  The maps developed for the Inland Northwest have been expanded to coastal forests and more recently to the national level.  The productivity potential of seedlings from seven superior-rated western larch orchard clones was examined in greenhouse and field trials and compared to open-pollinated stock. Growth, biomass allocation, and physiological response to drought imposed in a greenhouse study varied by family. The greatest response was observed for the extreme drought treatment (5% volumetric soil water content), which resulted in the smallest seedlings, but also the lowest allocation of biomass to roots. A field study was established at three locations that ranged across a latitudinal gradient.  Seedling growth and water stress varied by location after the first year, but no detectable differences in first year growth were observed. This was to be expected as seedlings were still establishing at the site. Height growth was negatively correlated with competing vegetation cover at one of the sites, decreasing by 38% between no competition and moderate competition.  We are seeking to Identify bacterium and fungi that live inside plant tissue (endophytes) that can be active in resistance to white pine blister rust (WPBR) caused by the Cronartium ribicola fungus.  This disease has destroyed many native soft pine trees and has had disastrous economic consequences. Genetic resistance to WPBR has been found and these resistant seedlings are planted throughout the Northwest, but it is still not entirely effective. We have identified two isolates from CAFS member JD Irving that produce chemicals known to defend against WPBR and four fresh isolates from seed of western white that show strong inhibition of C. ribicola in culture. Endophytes are proving to be a method to increase emergence of Western white pine seedlings and seed bacteria are favorable endophytes to use with forest trees.

"Averaged over millions of years, the rate of lava production at a seamount or island controls its final shape and size. Along long seamount chains, such as the Hawaiian-Emperor chain, observed seamount and island volumes change episodically indicating changes in the lava production rate responsible for their formation. The source of lavas forming these islands is believed to be the melting of mantle plumes: upwelling, stationary conduits of hot, chemically enriched material that originate from deep within the Earth's mantle and rise continuously to the surface. However, in contrast to observations, a continuously upwelling conduit would produce a nearly constant lava production rate; this project aims to address the processes that interrupt or perturb a continuously upwelling mantle plume, and, thus, the rate of lava production along hotspot island chains. Understanding the processes that control changes in lava production rate through time will provide insights into the fundamental connections between volcanoes at the surface and the dynamics of the deep Earth. There are two locations within the mantle where upwelling plumes are likely to be perturbed: 1) the core-mantle boundary, where anomalously dense material may be incorporated into the plume source and change the upwelling rate, and 2) in the mid-mantle, where abrupt changes in the phase, or mineral structure, of mantle rocks can alter the density and, thus, upwelling rate of plumes passing through these transitions. Changes in the upwelling rates will likely differ between these mechanisms and will result in time-varying changes in lava production rate at the surface that differ depending upon the mechanism responsible. The purpose of the proposed work is to use a combination of laboratory experiments and 3D numerical simulations to quantify the magnitude, length, and time scales over which variations in mantle plume upwelling caused by deep mantle processes will affect lava production and compositions at the Earth's surface, changing the shape and size of island chains. <br/><br/>The chemistry and flux of erupted lavas differ strikingly between hotspot seamount chains; some hotspots have nearly uniform chemical sources and volcanic output (e.g., Kerguelen), others vary episodically over millions of years (e.g., Hawaii), and yet others appear to decrease slowly with time (e.g., Louisville). The processes that control this inter-hotspot variability, as well as intra-hotspot variations, are poorly constrained.  The proposed work will quantify the degree to which two deep-mantle mechanisms affect plume upwelling and, in turn, observed surface manifestations of hotspots: 1) entrainment of material from Large Low Shear-wave Velocity Provinces (LLSVP), and 2) interaction with the mantle transition zone. This project will constrain the impact of these two mechanisms through combined laboratory and numerical experiments to quantify how deep mantle dynamics lead to predictable magnitudes, length-, and time-scales of variations in mantle plume upwelling and, consequently, melt production and erupted lava compositions at the Earth's surface. The first objective will be to document the range of surface variability in nature by assembling a global database of excess hotspot magmatism, spacing between volcanoes, and geochemical data (major and trace elements, and radiogenic isotopes) along age-progressive hotspot tracks. Next, the investigators will conduct complementary laboratory and numerical experiments to quantify the physics of each of the above mechanisms individually. Finally, numerical simulations including both mechanisms will assess their impact on surface manifestations of mantle plumes. Laboratory experiments will be conducted in glass-walled tanks filled with glucose syrup as an analogue for the mantle.  Using a 3D, finite-difference, marker-in-cell code, two sets of numerical simulations will be run for each process: 1) initial simulations with identical conditions to the laboratory experiments to verify the numerical approach, and 2) extension to more Earth-like conditions.

As cold, dense tectonic plates sink deep into the mantle at subduction zones, semi-stationary conduits of hot, chemically enriched material, or mantle plumes, rise buoyantly toward the Earth?s surface. These upwelling mantle plumes are the source of volcanic chains such as Hawaii. However, the simple definition of smoothly rising plumes does not explain variations in the rate of magma production in places like Hawaii, Louisville, and Kerguelen (Figure 1). Here, evidence suggests complex plume dynamics with upwelling rates (and thus volcanic production on the surface) varying over millions of years. This award aimed to: 1) quantify where and to what degree volcanic output varies along volcanic seamount chains throughout the ocean basins, 2) use a combination laboratory experiments and 3D numerical simulations to quantify how two processes deep in the mantle may affect the magnitude and time scales of variations in mantle plume upwelling.  First, we used existing observations to determine if variability in volcanic production occurs along Earth?s seamount chains and, if so, the details of those variations (e.g., period, magnitude, and distribution throughout the crust). To do this, we took two approaches. First, we examined the thickness of crust in areas where above average volcanic production has occurred near mid-ocean ridges (where the tectonic plates are spreading apart).  Second, we used bathymetry and measurements of gravity to calculate the volumes of  three components of seamount chains: 1) the volcanic edifice (visible at the surface or in bathymetry data), 2) the material emplaced above the crust, but hidden by bending the lithosphere beneath the volcanic edifice, and 3) underplated material (e.g., material that was magma beneath the crust, but never escaped to the surface as a volcanic eruption). The results of these calculations revealed that nearly all volcanic chains show a history of variable volcanic production at timescales on the order of several million years, suggesting that a deep process likely drives these variations.  After confirming the size of variations and how often they occur along seamount chains,  we used laboratory models to examine one process in the deep mantle that we hypothesized might contribute to these variations: entrainment of material that is thicker (higher viscosity) and more dense than the rest of the mantle material in the upwelling plume. Experiments were performed in a Plexiglas tank filled with a corn syrup-water mixture of known viscosity (a good proxy for flowing mantle). We then heated a small copper plate in the bottom, center of the tank to start a thermally buoyant plume. After the plume was established, a second corn syrup-water mixture with a different density and viscosity was injected very slowly along the base of the tank adjacent to the upwelling plume. This anomalous material was entrained into the upwelling plume and altered the upwelling rate and the pattern of upwelling in the plume. Results of these experiments are still in process, but initial work suggests that entrainment may alter the spatial pattern of volcanic production at the surface and cause some initial variability in upwelling rate, but does not appear to cause repeated variations in volcanic production, such as observed in the data during the first part of the project.  Finally, we used numerical models to simulate a portion of the Earth?s mantle and a single upwelling plume rising to the surface. Our model strives to include many of the complexities of the mantle that could not easily incorporated into our laboratory models: changes in mineral phase, a viscosity that depends strongly on temperature, depth, and the rate of deformation, and motion of a plate along the surface. Results show regular plume pulsing in the uppermost mantle every ~3.5-6.5 Myr. The time over which these pulses occur depends strongly on the viscosity contrast between the plume and the rest of the mantle. Overall, most plume pulsing in our models is caused by tilting of the plume stem in response to the moving plate at the surface. The timing of these pulses have important implications for melt production along hotspot chains at a similar periodicity as that of the formation of hotspot volcanoes.  Dissemination of the above results takes the forms of two graduate theses, one published manuscript, three conference presentations, and three further manuscripts in preparation. The broader impacts of this work include providing two graduate students training in numerical modeling, geophysical data analysis, proposal preparation, and manuscript preparation, and providing two undergraduate students research experiences that will likely lead to a publication in an international journal.

"The goal of the Career Launch in Engineering Scholarship Program (Career Launch) will be to significantly reduce the number of hours the S-STEM Career Launch scholars need to work outside of school as a means to help retain them to graduation and reduce time to degree completion. Career Launch will also create a systematic peer-mentoring program through the three cohorts of Career Launch scholars.  This project will address the need for highly qualified STEM professionals in industry, especially in the Pacific and Inland Northwest. Idaho is largely a rural state; however, a variety of high tech companies have large facilities within the state or surrounding areas, and they have an ongoing need for highly trained STEM professionals. This project will develop new recruiting pathways, retention, and support mechanisms for students, and placement efforts for graduates that will enable the University of Idaho to make a significant difference in terms of the quality and quantity of STEM professionals available to these industries.<br/><br/>The focus of the project will be on decreasing or eliminating the time that Career Launch students must spend at external jobs during the school year as well as increasing student support through  peer and faculty mentoring and enrichment activities.  Career Launch has three measurable objectives: (1) reduce the number of hours worked outside of school by a significant amount; (2) build a systematic mentoring program that will create a sense of community for the students; and (3) retain to degree completion a minimum of 22 Career Launch Scholars.  The program objectives will be achieved through (1) identification of high-quality students, (2) cohort development, (3) peer-mentoring program implementation, (4) engineering academic achievement, and (5) outcome-oriented evaluation. Specific components include peer-mentoring and cohort-building activities such as social, research, and orientation activities.

As a scholarship program, it has the specific goal of distributing scholarship funds to high achieving students with great financial need. As an NSF program, it is tasked with scientific goals of documenting, assessing, and analyzing the implementation of high impact educational activities within the STEM fields and furthering knowledge through dissemination. Meeting this set of goals has been a great challenge, however, students involved in this program have achieved success.  Idaho is largely a rural state; however, a variety of high-tech companies have large facilities within the state or surrounding area, and they have an ongoing need for highly trained STEM professionals. Based on previous experience, working students represented a highly motivated demographic, yet one clearly with high financial need limiting their educational progress.  A key hypothesis for this effort was that significantly reducing the tuition burden for students needing outside employment to cover education costs would result in students participating in activities that would improve retention, enrich their academic experience, reach out to peers, and assist with future career goals. The target pool for scholarship recipients had high financial need and were enrolled in STEM fields within the College of Engineering. These students were identified in coordination with instructors in first year courses, Student Support services and Financial Aid offices and were invited to apply to the program.  Twenty-five students have been supported by Career Launch in Engineering Scholarship Program. The students taking part in the Career Launch program achieved great success, essentially all program participants graduating during the program period; with the final program student needing only one more required course for graduation, and 100% remaining in the undergraduate degree program in which they began. All the students have reported that they were able to work fewer hours at their jobs, although some students with STEM-related internships continued working similar numbers of hours since the internship supported their career goals. Several students were able to become involved with undergraduate research. Ten of the students were from one or more groups underrepresented in engineering (six women, one African American, and four Hispanic). Seven students were provided additional study skills support through the program, which allowed six of them to raise their grades when they were struggling academically, including one who later became a member of the College of Engineering National Academy of Engineers Grand Challenges Scholars program. One stated the scholarship allowed them to graduate a year earlier than they would have otherwise. Most have improved their grades. Seven of the students have pursued postgraduate education, six in STEM fields and on in medical school. The remaining students have pursued STEM careers.   The program clearly identified target students with high capabilities and high need.  The program support demonstrably enhanced their peer interaction as seen activities such as leadership in student chapters of professional societies and serving as engineering ambassadors to aid in department and college recruitment and retention activities. The program provided opportunities for students to visit STEM industries in the region and put on workshops on topics such as preparing resumes and learning financial management life skills.   It is clear that the scholarship funds spent here made significant impact and were money well spent, but it is also clear that a scholarship-centered program can only persist as long as funds remain to be disbursed. Thus, a focus for future efforts for this team is to demonstrate that S-STEM funds can be used to prime a pump, such as driving new external financial support, perhaps from local and regional corporations, some of whom also hire H1-B visa holders who pay fees to support the NSF S-STEM program. Additional opportunities to create lasting impact include creating new self-supporting activities or systematically enhancing the operation of existing Student Support services.   While our NSF S-STEM program has succeeded in assisting STEM students with high financial need to graduate and obtain STEM employment; several questions have arisen for future efforts, and additional long-term support has not been forthcoming from within or without the investigator?s university. In particular, key challenges to sustain this valuable program are identifying stable staffing and coordination structures, some perhaps already present within our institution, and external funding avenues for long-term support. As these issues are unlikely to be unique to our institution, working towards their resolution will further broaden efforts in STEM education.

"Volcanoes and volcanic activity present significant natural hazards, but they are poorly understood.  The principal goal of this project is to constrain the proccess that regulate the timing, location, and volumes of volcanism at the Earth's surface, specifically within continental rifts, but more broadly in any region undergoing tectonic extension.  Observations at continental rifts, such as the East African Rift, find changes in the style of volcanism from widely, irregularly spaced volcanic centers in areas with small amounts of extension to surprisingly regularly spaced, uniform volcanoes in significantly extended regions.  We propose that the changes in volcanic style may be controlled by a balance between the location of faults and fractures near the surface and the variability of magma production beneath the crust, in the Earth's mantle. To determine the role of these two processes and how those roles may change with extension, will will use both numerical simulations and analogue laboratory models to develop mathematical tools that will inform our understanding of the drivers of volcanic activity in these areas.<br/><br/>As continental rifts evolve, volcanic centers within rift valleys often develop a characteristic spacing, or wavelength, such as observed in the Red Sea Rift and within the Afar depression, the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER), and the Kenya (Gregory) Rift of the East African Rift System (EARS). The surprisingly regular spacing of the volcanic centers within the EARS is attributed to lithosphere thickness, pre-existing fault systems, and mantle processes. However, little quantitative assessment of these hypotheses has been undertaken and few studies attempt to include the visco-elastic-plastic rheology of the lithosphere. The primary goal of this work is to use data from coupled numerical and laboratory experiments along with observations from the East African Rift System (EARS) to quantitatively assess the contribution of both melt production and melt extraction processes on the distribution of volcanic activity along the three main branches of the actively spreading EARS. We will perform two groups of coupled laboratory and numerical experiments; the first will simulate Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities within the partially molten mantle (melt production), and the second will simulate the importance of pre-existing fractures and volcano loading on surface volcanism (melt extraction). Numerically, we will use a 3D marker-in-cell, finite difference code to initially match the laboratory experiments and then expand the parameter range beyond that possible in the laboratory. Both sets of experiments will vary rift opening rate, lithospheric thickness, pre-exiting fractures, and volcanic loading. Finally, we will develop predictive scaling laws that relate volcano spacing and volume to the above parameters. These scaling laws will permit the use of surface observations to estimate the relative importance of melt production below the lithosphere versus melt extraction through the lithosphere in both the EARS and other continental rifts.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,225924.00,225924,4900,GeoPRISMS,1456664,,Eric L Mittelstaedt,875 Perimeter Dr.,Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443022,emittelstaedt@uidaho.edu,Eric,Mittelstaedt,jwade@nsf.gov,Jennifer Wade,7032924739,"['01001516DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001617DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",03/03/2015,05/01/2015,01/31/2019,Emplacement of regularly spaced volcanic centers in the East African Rift: Melt production or melt extraction?,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,L,"['Nature Geoscience~2018~~Sibrant, A.

Magmatism is a key factor in continental breakup, but the way magma is delivered to the rift is poorly known. Along the northern part of the EARS, magma erupts and forms volcanoes in a regularly spaced pattern. This project aims to determine whether this spacing is caused by magma formation or the how magma rises through fractures in the continental plate. To address this question, we used both numerical modeling and laboratory experiments.  In the numerical simulations we examined how low density (partially melted) plumes of mantle rock would rise toward the surface and how different parameters would affect the spacing between these plumes. The laboratory models focused on how the strength of a rift might control its shape and how this related to magma injections versus breaking along faults. Results from the numerical models show that conditions similar to that beneath the EARS could cause upwelling plumes of partially molten mantle with preferred spacings similar to the volcanoes observed within the rift, suggesting a mantle upwelling control on melt delivery to the rift.  Results from the laboratory models suggest that the amount of magma delivered to a divergent plate boundary (e.g., continental rift or mid-ocean ridge) likely controls its overall shape and the linearity of the rift axis, perhaps explaining the large-scale shape of mid-ocean ridges &ndash; the final bi-product of continental rifting.

"Adaptive radiation and ecological opportunity are known to play major roles in the formation of new biodiversity.  In this model, a few ancestral species diversify rapidly to fill ecological space with a variety of new morphological and ecological strategies. Recently, hybridization among closely related species has been hypothesized to play an important role during the early stages of an adaptive radiation, but studies investigating this process in plants are currently lacking. This project will evaluate the role of hybridization in facilitating an adaptive radiation using the Andean plant genus Lachemilla (Rosaceae) as a model.  Lachemilla comprises approximately 50 described species and is restricted to high elevation habitats throughout the Andes. Phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast and single-copy nuclear DNA gene sequences from multiple Lachemilla species will first be used to reconstruct evolutionary relationships.  Using this evolutionary framework, researchers will then use a variety of statistical approaches to investigate the role played by hybridization in driving diversification within the lineage.  This research will provide extensive training in systematics and evolutionary biology to a graduate student, and enhance international scientific collaboration with researchers in Ecuador. This project will provide training for one undergraduate student in laboratory techniques and data analysis, and also provide valuable mentoring experience for the co-PI. <br/><br/>This project will use phylogenetic methods to investigate and test the hybrid swarm origin and syngameon hypotheses for the generation of functional diversity during an adaptive radiation using the plant genus Lachemilla (Rosaceae). A robust and comprehensive phylogeny from hundreds of Lachemilla accessions using high-throughput sequencing approaches of whole chloroplast and multiple single-copy nuclear regions will be generated using Bayesian approaches.  This phylogenetic framework will then be used to first test for evidence of hybridization, and then investigate whether morphological, functional, and phylogenetic diversification in the clade coincides with hybridization events.

Hybridization&mdash;the exchange of genes between different species&mdash;is sometimes recognized as an important process in the evolution of animals and fungi, but seems to be a ubiquitous feature of the evolutionary history of plants where it is particularly prominent. Hybrid speciation can occur either by keeping the same genome size&mdash;homoploid hybrid speciation&mdash;or more frequently via hybridization and genome duplication&mdash;allopolyploidy. Hybridization, in the form of homoploid hybrid speciation and polyploidy has contributed extensively to angiosperm diversity, but also represents a great challenge for phylogenetic reconstruction due the incongruence patterns that a reticulate process produces within and between the nuclear and chloroplast genomes. Additional processes can also produce similar reticulate patterns, creating the necessity to disentangle these processes and model phylogenetic networks that best represent species relationships in the presence of reticulation, rather than a classic bifurcating tree.  This work combined extensive natural history collections with a plurality of molecular phylogenetic methods to elucidate the reticulate evolutionary history of the plant genus Lachemilla in the rose family. This is a morphologically highly variable group of ca. 60 species that includes perennial herbs and shrubs, with a nearly ubiquitous presence in the Neotropical high-altitude grasslands and remarkable diversity in the Andes. First, we reconstructed the phylogeny of Lachemilla using nuclear ribosomal ITS and plastid trnL-F DNA sequences. We identified four major clades in Lachemilla that are in part congruent with previous morphological classifications of the group. However, widespread patterns of cytonuclear discordance was detected that, in combination with chromosome counts and genome size estimates, provided evidence of the putative allopolyploid origin of multiple species. Finally, we established the date of origin of Lachemilla to be around 15 million years ago, with a rapid accumulation of lineages during the last five million years.  Furthermore, we conducted a phylogenomic analysis of 396 loci from low-copy nuclear genes and complete chloroplast sequences to clarify the relationships among the major groups of Lachemilla, and explore a multiple of sources of conflict among gene trees and species trees. All phylogenetic approaches used recovered the four major groups previously proposed for Lachemilla, but these methods all recovered different topologies for the relationships of these four clades. Species network analyses revealed that one of the four major clades is actually of ancient hybrid origin, and represents one of the main sources of the incongruence among the species trees. Additionally, we found evidence for a whole genome duplication event shared by Lachemilla and allied genera.  Additionally, we used PCR target enrichment in combination with high- throughput sequencing to obtain allelic information for the nuclear ribosomal cistron and multiple regions of the plastid genome in 219 samples of 48 species of Lachemilla, to provide direct evidence of the allopolyploid speciation in this group. We found evidence of the allopolyploid origin of 30 species of Lachemilla, demonstrating that this condition is common and widespread in the genus. Additionally, based on a well-resolved chloroplast phylogeny, we identified that the monotypic genus Farinopsis is the sister group of Lachemilla and allied genera within subtribe Fragariinae. However, this result is discordant with the nrDNA phylogeny, a pattern also observed between Lachemilla and allied genera, which corroborates the notion of widespread hybridization in Fragariinae.  Finally, with the extensive fieldwork that we conducted throughout the Neotropics, we discovered and described the new species Lachemilla mexiquense, which is endemic to central Mexico. This species is characterized by a unique combination of characters in the genus, and through the network-based analyses that we conducted, was later shown to be of hybrid origin.  With all this work, we have attempted to clarify the role that hybridization has played in the evolutionary history of Lachemilla. This work will not only facilitate continued research questions, including historical biogeography, diversification patterns, trait evolution, and future taxonomic treatments of the genus, but also broader questions regarding the evolutionary and ecological consequences of polyploidy and hybridization.

"Studies of the process of speciation, or the splitting of one species into two, have most often taken the approach of intensive study of a single species or species pair, and have therefore focused on the primary driver of divergence of that one event. If instead, we take a longer-time, evolutionary view of speciation, examined through the lens of evolutionary relationships and the traits that are important for recognizing and defining species, we have the opportunity to investigate the relative contributions of the properties of a species at both the level of recent speciation events and back through the evolutionary history of the group. This implies that we can confidently identify and describe species. Molecular, morphological, ecological, and/or geographic variation often serve as evidence of boundaries between one species and another, however, when used alone, these characteristics are not always capable of differentiating species. This study will contribute significantly to empirical tests of the theory and methodologies of species delimitation, and will bridge the gap between theoretical, empirical, and applied sciences. By working towards definitions of species that reflect their evolutionary histories, this project will contribute to the discovery, conservation, and management of biodiversity in western North America. Finally, this research will directly impact the training and academic development of the co-PI through the learning of new laboratory, field, and analytical techniques, as well as the mentoring and training of undergraduates. <br/><br/>This project aims to identify the macroevolutionary signatures of speciation via the identification of species criteria, the robust delimitation of species, and the evaluation of the contribution of individual species criteria across a phylogeny, to begin to construct a broad picture of speciation in the mountains of western North America.

Single-copy nuclear loci.~~~~~~2018-07-30 14:51:23.586~']"," The genus Castilleja (also known as ?the paintbrushes?) is an iconic and widespread group of plants. Infrageneric classifications in this young and rapid radiation have long been fraught with difficulty, mostly attributed to high incidence of polyploidy and interspecific gene flow when species co-occur. Subsequently, taxonomies have nearly continuous morphological and ecological diagnostic characters across species boundaries. This has resulted in the genus Castilleja being notoriously taxonomically difficult. This project aimed to collect the data necessary to delimit species in a widespread, particularly challenging complex of species in Castilleja (the Miniata complex), in addition to exploring the application of the evidence to the delimitation of species boundaries and inference of evolutionary relationships across the genus. During the course of this project, we have explored the signal of species boundaries present in various types of data (molecular, morphological, ecological) that are widely used to delimit species boundaries. Additionally, we have explored the capability of current approaches to delimit species using these types of data, all in a system that presents tremendous amounts of interspecific similarity. Each of these types of data has required the use of suites of methods and analytical tools, some applied in new and novel ways, to delimit species. As a result, we have created data collection and analysis pipelines appropriate for Castilleja, allowing us to collect data in an efficient and consistent manner across the genus, as well as within the Miniata alliance.  Recently, the use of multiple, independent approaches to molecular delimitation has been advocated as a means of accommodating the limitations of a single approach; however, this can result in incongruent delimitation schemes (i.e., where one approach delimits differently than another) with no widely used objective way to mitigate incongruence. Our work, in part, utilizes post-hoc simulations to address the capability of each approach to correctly delimit species boundaries, particularly in the face of small sample sizes. In this project we have also examined the application of environmental variables to the question of species boundaries. Given robustly estimated species ranges using carefully vetted collections, we estimated species distribution models that allow us to quantify and compare the environmental niches of putative species. Importantly, we explore the impact of different analytical techniques on the comparisons that comprise our delimitation, directly addressing the impact of range size asymmetry and overlap, two components common to Castilleja and other, young lineages. We have also considered the morphological variability that may or may not be present in putative species, as defined by current taxonomy. By quantifying the amount of morphological similarity in a species complex, we show that morphological characters do not always distinguish taxonomic entities, suggesting morphological distinction among species may not always align with environmental or molecular distinction.  Our work highlights the fact that when validating species boundaries in incipient lineages, multiple lines of evidence should be carefully scrutinized. Additionally, this work highlights the importance of careful analysis of the data when working in non-model systems. We find that the impact of small sample sizes, range size asymmetry and overlap, and an assumption of variation that follows taxonomic boundaries, can be quantified and should therefore be examined when working in incipient lineages such as Castilleja. Finally, this system exemplifies why robustly defined species are essential for broader, genus-wide understanding of evolutionary relationships.

These interests range from molecular processes of evolutionary change to the adaptation of organisms on the landscape level. Students will have the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects that address current questions with cutting-edge approaches in state-of-the-art facilities. The program is structured to involve students in all aspects of scientific investigation and to excite and inspire them through direct exposure to current research in evolutionary biology. Weekly research seminars, a series of career development workshops, an ethics/responsible conduct of research component, and a variety of social activities will facilitate student learning and development. The program will conclude with a student research symposium. Students from institutions with limited opportunities for research as well as students from underrepresented minority groups and first generation college students will be targeted during recruiting efforts. An on-line application process will be utilized. <br/><br/>It is anticipated that a total of 30 students will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted and will be mentored toward increased independence as the program progresses. Many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.<br/><br/>A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.

Projects were structured around 10-week summer research programs. Program elements were designed to positively influence undergraduates toward postgraduate education and careers in science. From 2015 &ndash; 2017, a total of 31 students were recruited from around the country to participate in this program. Each student designed and conducted his/her own independent research project under the guidance of a faculty mentor. Some student projects addressed questions that combined field and laboratory work while others were strictly laboratory-based.     In addition to student research, this program included weekly research seminars, a series of career development workshops, and a variety of organized social activities designed to facilitate student learning and development. Each 10-week program concluded with a half-day student research symposium at the University of Idaho during which students presented the results of their summer work to other undergraduate researchers, graduate students, faculty, and members of the general public. Students presented their results in both oral and poster format.     Recruitment strategies were designed to attract a diverse group of students from a wide range of institutions. Of the total number of students who participated in this program, 57% were from racial or ethnic minority groups, 80% were women, and 80% were from institutions other than the University of Idaho. 63% of the students were from institutions with limited opportunities for research and 30% were first generation college students. Finally, our 31 REU students represented 23 different home institutions located in 17 different states and Puerto Rico.     An important outcome of this program was its direct contribution to the development of human resources. By involving undergraduate students in hands-on, faculty-mentored research, this program integrated research activities with student education in science. Through direct participation in research, students were trained in how to approach questions using the scientific method. Critical thinking skills were reinforced throughout the program. Furthermore, this program included a diverse mix of students, including members of underrepresented minority groups, first-generation college students, and students from institutions were access to research opportunities is limited. Program elements were designed to positively influence students toward post-graduate education and careers in the sciences. Consequently, this program yielded a diverse set of students who possess the appropriate skills and preparation to enter and excel in postgraduate education in science.

"Interactions between species play an important role in the function of biological communities and have important implications for human health and agriculture. For instance, interactions between pathogens and their hosts influence the stability of natural communities and shape the spread of infectious disease within human populations. Similarly, interactions between plants and pollinators are essential for the proper functioning of natural communities and also for the efficient and economical operation of agricultural systems. For these reasons, predicting how species interactions change over time is important for understanding biological communities, managing agricultural systems, and minimizing infectious disease. Unfortunately, our ability to predict how species interactions change over time is poor, in part because the forces driving evolution of interacting species is not well understood. This research will develop new mathematical and statistical methods for estimating the strength of coevolution, a force long hypothesized to play a key role in the evolution of species interactions. The research will also provide significant opportunities for graduate student training at the interface of mathematics, statistics, computation, and biology and thus contribute to human resource development in STEM. Ultimately, the mathematical and statistical tools developed by the research will be made available to the scientific community through development of free computer software; this software will allow the strength of coevolution to be easily estimated in a broad range biological systems. <br/><br/>Two broad classes of techniques currently exist for inferring the strength of coevolutionary selection in natural populations: (1) Direct techniques that make robust inferences but are limited to specific types of systems and small numbers of populations, and (2) indirect techniques that can be applied to a broad range of systems and large numbers of populations but which provide inferences of questionable robustness. Even under the best case scenario, both techniques generally yield only qualitative results and thus cannot provide crucial quantitative information on the intensity of coevolutionary selection in natural populations. This research will capitalize on recent advances in Bayesian statistics to develop novel methods for estimating parameters of well-established coevolutionary models using data routinely collected as part of broad scale studies of trait matching in species interactions. Once these new statistical methods have been thoroughly tested using simulated data, they will be used to estimate the strength of coevolutionary selection in a textbook example of coevolution - the interaction between toxic newts and their garter snake predators.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,251014.00,251014,4900,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,1450653,,Scott L Nuismer,875 Perimeter Drive,Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443051,snuismer@uidaho.edu,Scott,Nuismer,sscheine@nsf.gov,Samuel Scheiner,7032927175,"['01001516DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001617DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001718DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",04/01/2015,04/01/2015,05/31/2020,A Bayesian Approach to Inferring the Strength of Coevolution,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,L,"['Journal of Evolutionary Biology~2016~30~MacPherson, A.

Despite its perceived importance, estimating the contemporary strength of coevolution in natural communities of interacting species is extremely challenging. Work on this project developed new methods for estimating the strength of this process by capitalizing on recent advances in computational statistics. These new methods make estimating the strength of coevolution much easier than it has been in the past. As a proof of concept, work on this project applied these new methods to two biological systems where the importance of coevolution had long been suspected but impossible to quantify. Our results confirmed the presence of coevolution in these systems and allowed its strength to be measured for the first time.  In addition to developing new statistical methods, work on this project contributed to the development of a national workforce trained at the interface of biology, mathematics, and statistics. Specifically, over the course of the project a PhD student with an undergraduate degree in mathematics was introduced to ecology and evolution and trained to apply their mathematical skills to biological problems. This student has now graduated and is currently applying their skills to problems in genomics while receiving further training.          Last Modified: 09/30/2020       Submitted by: Scott L Nuismer"
"Study of ancient (paleo-) ecosystems preserved in the Navajo Sandstone, the largest sand sea (eolian) system ever known that was deposited between 190 and 175 million years ago (Lower Jurassic), will provide crucial information to understanding biotic, water (hydrology), and landscape (environments) during a greenhouse period of global climate. Results will reveal how biotic community structure responded to climate changes during the transition from wetter to drier eolian landscape successions. This study will transform how biodiversity, hydrology, and environmental factors of the largest eolian systems are interpreted for understanding Earth history. This study will be a model for evaluating climate sensitivities in eolian systems, and provide guidance on future hydrologic, ecologic, and climatic studies in global warming cycles. Research will have broad impacts to interpret the links between biological, chemical, and physical sediment records in a paleoclimate context. Our collaboration has a firm commitment to increase involvement of undergraduate and graduate students of underrepresented groups in research and training, and training of Earth/Space Science education majors and teachers. Each Investigator is involved with outreach or geologic education efforts. Study results will have high visibility to the public because of the prominence of the Navajo Sandstone in so many of the Colorado Plateau's National Parks, Monuments, public lands, and wilderness areas. Partnerships with government agencies will ensure broad dissemination of scientific results to the general public and secondary geoscience teachers via video modules, pictures, and science content for websites, publications or brochures.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary study will examine the sedimentology, hydrology, and biology recorded within paleoecosystems of the Lower Jurassic Navajo Sandstone (Ss) on the Colorado Plateau, USA. The Navajo Ss represents the largest erg system ever known, deposited during the: (1) disintegration of the megamonsoonal climate system after the breakup of Pangea; (2) early diversification of mammals; and (3) increased diversity and dominance of dinosaurs in continental ecosystems. Two hypotheses to understand the response of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to high-frequency climatic changes that affected paleohydrologic and paleoenvironmental settings in a variably arid landscape will be integrated into one generalized model: (H1) The climatic and paleohydrologic status of the Navajo Ss evolved from relatively moist in the lower part to relatively dry in the upper part, as well as regionally moist to dry from east to west. (H2) Groundwater evolved from fresh to saline from east to west across the basin, and biota was strongly influenced by its distribution and the change in water chemistry, such that animal body size, based on burrow diameters, decreases up-section and regionally towards the west. Field and laboratory studies will include: (1) stratigraphic and sedimentologic analyses in a stratigraphic framework to systematically document vertical changes, with the objective to subdivide the Navajo Ss: (2) C and O stable isotopic and petrographic analyses of tufas to provide data on paleoclimate and changes in the water budget; and (3) ichnological and paleontological analyses integrated with sedimentologic, stratigraphic, petrographic, and geochemical analyses of clastic and carbonate facies that represent a variety of paleoenvironments. Efforts will focus in the area northwest of Moab, UT, which is the highest priority target area with a high concentration of burrowed zones, plant fossils, and tufa and lacustrine deposits to address H1 and H2. Outcrop exposure is exceptionally good, which will facilitate establishing reliable timelines.

Much of the scenery in Utah parks (e.g., Arches, Canyonlands, and, especially Zion national parks, and in Sand Flats and Glen Canyon national recreation areas) is Navajo Sandstone.  The Navajo represents the largest sand dune desert in Earth history. This reports the findings of a collaborative project among geology principal investigators at the University of Idaho, University of Kansas, and University of Utah.  Scientists from North Carolina State University, New York State University at Stony Brook, Washington State University, and the University of Texas, Arlington, also participated.  In addition, the principal investigators worked with the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and the Canyonlands Natural History Association.  The Navajo Sandstone is often held up as the archetype for a hyperarid desert.  Although the presence of small interdune lakes was recognized, this study has demonstrated that the hydrology of this vast desert was far more dynamic than previously thought.  This study demonstrated that the dynamism of this hydrology was expressed in many ways:  A variety in size and abundance of soft-sediment-deformation features.  Soft-sediment deformation occurs when sediment is disrupted and liquefied, for example, by an earthquake, destroying the original sedimentary structures and homogenizing the sediment.  Sometimes the disrupted sediment erupted violently onto the land surface.  The evidence for this is folding and overturning of overlying beds.  The structures range from pipe cylinders a few centimeters across to large conical injectite structures many meters across and tens of meters high. Interdune lakes.  Some of the interdune lakes were as large as two kilometers across and a meter or so deep.  They were occupied by fish, ostracodes, clams, snails, and algae; limestone was deposited in these lakes, indicating they were not just ephemeral as so many desert lakes are.  The shallow margins of the lakes supported large trees and other plants and were trampled by dinosaurs and recorded insect trackways.  The abundance of life indicates that, at least in some stages of their existence, the lakes provided fresh water.  This is also supported by geochemical analyses that indicate freshwater. Springs.  The Navajo Sandstone is dotted with limestone spring deposits.  Most of these occur in association with lakes, which probably were fed by the springs.  In others, the water flowed just fast enough to build a limestone mound, but not enough to feed a lakes. Abundant life.  Although most of the life was associated with the lakes, by no means was all of it.  Whenever there was a pause in dune deposition, the land surface was rapidly colonized by plants and burrowing invertebrate and vertebrate animals, ranging in size from insects to medium-sized reptiles.  Along some ancient land surfaces, we can trace the burrowed beds laterally into interdune lakes.  Even a few dinosaurs came to the water?s edge in the oases of the Jurassic desert.   Overall, our studies elucidate the archives of history in the spectacular and diverse landscape of the southwestern U.S.  This is an important part of our geological heritage.

"This workshop will bring together and international group of scientists to synthesize research knowledge and identify research priorities about the interactions between plants and their associated microbes. Plants obtain a variety of benefits from microbes, including nutrient acquisition and efficiency, disease resistance, and stress tolerance. However, the microbes studied constitute a miniscule fraction of the diversity associated with plants. New molecular and computational tools now make it practical to conduct comprehensive, inquiry-based studies of plant-associated microbiomes. Improving our understanding of microbiomes and optimizing them for domesticated crop plants is expected to greatly enhance sustainability in agricultural systems. To ensure that the outcomes of the meeting will be broadly used, it will include scientists from the U.S., Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America, and representatives of non-profit and governmental organizations. <br/> <br/>In the face of challenges posed by climate change and population growth, the motivation for the proposed meeting is to make rapid progress in our understanding of the potential contribution of plant-associated microbiomes to agricultural productivity and sustainability. A focused meeting among leading experts in a variety of related fields will be uniquely effective in initiating collaborations that accelerate research on understanding and utilizing plant-associated microbiomes. The objectives of the proposed meeting are: (i) synthesize the current state of knowledge, and associated technologies, in crop plant breeding and crop plant microbiomes; (ii) identify critical research needs in these areas, set research goals, and identify new collaborations; (iii) initiate publications to communicate the developed consensus around future research objectives and priorities and develop new collaborative research projects.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,36001.00,36001,4900,Plant Genome Research Project,1519383,,Posy E Busby,,Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838441133,posy.busby@oregonstate.edu,Posy,Busby,sscheine@nsf.gov,Samuel Scheiner,7032927175,['01001516DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],01/28/2015,02/01/2015,01/31/2017,"Meeting Proposal: Microbiomes for Sustainable Agriculture; Asilomar, CA - Summer, 2015",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Chinmay P Soman'],E,,"This proposal, led by NSF SEES Postdoctoral Fellows Posy Busby (University of Idaho, Duke University) and Chinmay Soman (University of Illinois), supported an international meeting of approximately 40 experts on plant microbiomes at Asilomar CA in March 2016. The meeting participants came from a wide variety of backgrounds, including academia, industry, non-profit organizations, governmental agencies, and funding agencies. The purpose of the meeting was to identify research priorities for improving our understanding of plant-associated microbiomes and our ability to optimize microbiomes (e.g., those including microbes that improve plant growth, nutrient use efficiency, abiotic stress tolerance and disease resistance) for enhanced agricultural productivity and sustainability. The research priorities identified at the meeting include: developing model host-microbiome systems for crop plants, defining core microbiomes and metagenomes in these model systems, elucidating the rules of synthetic, functionally programmable microbiome assembly, determining the functional mechanisms of plant-microbiome interactions, and characterizing plant genotype-by-environment-by-microbiome-by-management interactions. If scientists and farmers work together on these research goals, we believe that improvements will be made in agricultural microbiome manipulations and management strategies, with benefits to global agricultural sustainability.

"Whether evolution of the Ebola virus will lead to changes in infectivity is currently unknown. During the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, evidence suggests that the virus has had a higher rate of genetic change, substitution rate, than in prior outbreaks. The investigators will study how genetic evolution may make the virus more or less infectious, how it will either help or hinder the human immune response to Ebola virus infections, and how viral evolution will impact existing and future therapies. <br/><br/>The region of interest on the Ebola genome encodes for a glycoprotein that is located on the surface of the virus and infected cells.  It is an important target for neutralizing antibodies and changes in its function and morphology could impact antibody recognition. The investigators will determine the functional implications from the recent and historic evolution of the Ebola virus, as well as model all possible mutations that could interrupt binding between the glycoprotein and antibodies but that would not significantly reduce folding stability.

It is essential that strategies for treatment and containment be developed to avoid future epidemics of this magnitude. Our interest is in understanding the evolution of this deadly virus, and whether this evolution could compromise treatment efforts. There has been a considerable investment in sequencing EBOV strains which has informed/enabled/made possible this study.  We have initiated a watch list of amino acid mutations that may decrease our ability to treat patients during an Ebola outbreak. These mutations were identified by modeling the physical interactions between the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) and an antibody KZ52 as illustrated in Figure 1. Molecular modeling was used to estimate whether mutations affected the stability of the antibody interaction and the stability of GP. Every possible mutation of GP was considered and the watch list was generated from those that are predicted to disrupt GP-KZ52 binding but not to disrupt the ability of GP to form a functional protein complex. In Figure 2, the points colored red satisfy these criteria since they are near zero on the y-axis (do not disrupt the formation of a functional protein complex) yet are above our chosen threshold on the x-axis (disrupt the antibody interaction). The resulting watch list contains 34 mutations (one of which has already been seen during an outbreak) at six sites. The locations of the watch list mutations on the structure are shown in Figure 1 as red spheres. Should mutations from the watch list appear and spread during an epidemic, it would warrant attention as these mutations may indicate that the virus is evolving in response to treatment and suggest a reduced effectiveness of interventions. However, this watch list is incomplete because structures are not available showing the interaction between GP and other known antibodies. This emphasizes the need for more structural data in order to expand the watch list to other interaction sites. We hope that this work provokes experimental research on evolutionary escape in both Ebola and other viral pathogens.  Additionally, we have studied EBOV GP to understand how this protein accumulates mutations within and between Ebola outbreaks. We found that the common view of the historical relationships among EBOV from different outbreaks obscures the fact that it evolves within a non-human reservoir (likely fruit bats) in an uninterrupted manner that is independent of the human outbreaks (Figure 3). We also identified amino acid sites within GP that have independently mutated multiple times in the last 40 years, which may reflect adaptation of EBOV to primate hosts. We then mapped these changes onto the GP protein structure. There are structural characteristics of GP that help EBOV evade the human immune system, and the evolution of the protein sequences of these structures reflects the relationships between protein structure and function. The first third of GP codes for two proteins. One of these proteins, the highly expressed secreted GP, may trick the host immune system into wasting its resources. This removes the pressure on EBOV to accumulate amino acid substitutions in this part of GP which might be detrimental to the function of the protein. The middle third of GP encodes a region that accumulates mutations at a high rate. This region is known to be a mucin-like domain, has attachment sites for sugar molecules, and is highly flexible. It is a characteristic of this protein domain that it can support many mutations without altering its flexibility or losing sugar attachment sites, thus helping EBOV avoid the host immune system.

"It is known that streams collect, process, and release much of a basin's water. It is less known that streams also collect, process, and release much of a basin's carbon. Carbon is collected by streams in various forms, some of that carbon is processed by microbes in the streambed into carbon dioxide (CO2), and much of that CO2 is vented to the atmosphere during downstream flow.  These processes are particularly important in small, headwater streams.  Since headwater basins drain significant land surface, these coupled water-carbon processes may be globally significant.  This project will measure, model, and understand this coupled water-carbon cycle via intensive study of the stream carbon cycle within one headwater stream draining a 96-hectare basin in western Oregon. By using the Watershed 1 of the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest, this study will leverage a history of detailed data collection and a large number of existing measurements.  The project team will partner with the Audubon Society to teach 1000 school children stream hydrology and ecology in the field.<br/><br/>This project has two main goals. The first is to develop an integrated modeling framework to simulate carbon cycling in streams that is widely transferable to model subsurface and surface processes of streams in earth system models. The second is to test and present an integrated theory of stream and groundwater hydrology, carbon biogeochemistry, and CO2 production and efflux in a stream. These goals will be accomplished by developing an integrated carbon model for headwater streams that simulates hydrologic processes (e.g., transport, hyporheic exchange) and biogeochemical processes (e.g., transformation between particulate and dissolved organic carbon, aerobic respiration rates of these carbon ""pools""). Modeling will be coupled with direct measurements of groundwater delivery of soil-respired CO2, biological and physical processes controlling carbon cycling, measurements of dissolved oxygen, hydrology, and CO2 efflux from the stream to subcanopy respiration measured at a flux tower above the stream. In situ hyporheic mesocosms will be used to manipulate and monitor reactive transport along flow paths to parameterize biogeochemical rate expressions for use in the integrated model.

Streams also vent CO2 that is sourced from soil respiration and delivered to streams via groundwater. These CO2 fluxes are globally significant, however estimates of their magnitude are poorly constrained. The locations with the largest fluxes are likely to be headwater streams which comprise more than 60% of stream networks, are the primary locations for groundwater discharge, and the part of the stream network where the carbon budget is most strongly influenced by hyporheic processes. Unfortunately, measuring carbon cycling and CO2 efflux from headwater streams is problematic because direct measurement of all the factors influencing carbon cycling is difficult, if not impossible, and single site measurements are not easily transferable to other streams.   Our project?s major findings agree with newer paradigms on microbial utilization of organic matter and extend these paradigms to biogeochemical processing of OM in headwater mountain streams: (1) quality and composition of carbon has less impact on hyporheic biogeochemical reaction than previously thought, (2) addition of microbially-accessible carbon substrate can induce priming of sediment-associated organic carbon in the hyporheic zone (HZ), and (3) buried particulate organic carbon is critically important to the carbon processing in the HZ of (this) mountain streams.  The major scientific goals of the project were to understand the influence of temperate headwater streams on CO2 fluxes from watersheds. More specifically, we sought to tighten constraints on the stream carbon budget through process understanding of hyporheic exchange and carbon biogeochemistry. To do this, we designed and built a stream-side hyporheic mesocosm facility to use as an experimental platform to examine the effects of carbon quantity and quality on hyporheic respiration and transformations and fluxes of carbon through the HZ.  We combined the mesocosm experiments with direct measurements of the biological and physical processes controlling carbon cycling through the in-situ HZ using a previously established network of wells and in-stream piezometers. Together, these studies a`llowed us to manipulate and monitor reactive transport along hyporheic flow paths and calculate biogeochemical reaction rates, thereby developing a better understanding of how quantity and quality of stream organic carbon affects C-flux through the HZ.    We addressed questions about the relative effects of varying quantities and qualities of DOC (e.g., acetate, humic acid, alder leaf leachate and forest floor leachate) on hyporheic respiration and carbon flux with a suite of controlled mesocosm injection experiments.  We observed large increases in O2 consumption and production of DIC, suggesting that hyporheic metabolism was carbon limited. However, differences between sodium acetate and humic acid were striking. While both were completely consumed along the 2-m mesocosm flowpath, addition of humic acid did not produce a parallel change in O2 and DIC. Suggesting that humic acid was lost from solution through adsorption whereas sodium acetate was metabolized, and that increasing the amount of microbially available DOC (e.g. sodium acetate) can induce priming of sediment-associated organic carbon in the HZ.  This pattern was confirmed in our experiments using sodium acetate or natural leachates.  These results contrast dramatically with Bengtsson et al. (2014) that reported a lack of priming effect in the HZ.  Observations in the mesocosms were similar to those observed under baseflow conditions in the well field (Corson-Rikert et al., 2016), confirming that heterotrophic metabolism of stream-source DOC cannot, alone, account for the amount of DIC produced or the amount of DO consumed.  Further, mesocosm results strongly support the conclusion that respiration of buried particulate organic carbon accounts for a large portion of hyporheic metabolism in this stream.  If we assume a 1:1 respiratory quotient (i.e., 1 CH2O + 1 O2 = 1 H2O + 1 CO2), then stream-source DOC accounts for 13% of the total respiration during summer and fall seasons, and as much as 49% of the total respiration during winter and spring seasons.  Our experiments and these analyses, indicate buried particulate organic carbon is critically important to carbon processing in the HZ of this mountain stream.  This project improved understanding of how quality and quantity of DOC affect carbon flux from headwater streams in the context of the specific hydrology of our experimental system.  However, additional work is needed to understand how these factors interact to affect overall carbon flux from headwater streams.  Our outreach and education program provided exposure to, and basic training in, hydrologic sciences to more than 940 fourth and fifth graders, and more than 100 adults, in the Corvallis area (location of Oregon State University).  PI Feris expanded our outreach program by developing a similar suite of activities for use educating and connecting with students in Idaho.  Additionally, this project developed a unique hyporheic mesocosm facility.  The facility was built to last for at least a decade, and will catalyze new collaborations and experiments that will yield novel insights into hyporheic processes for many years to come.

"Tree species distributions can shrink over time through reduced regeneration and subsequent adult mortality or they can expand via seedling establishment beyond current distribution boundaries.  Therefore, a critical component of our ability to predict future species distributions is an understanding of the mechanisms of seedling establishment, which requires a fundamental knowledge of seedling physiology.  The water pathway from the root to the leaf is critically important for maintaining leaf water status and allowing stomata to stay open, resulting in carbon capture through photosynthesis.  However, water transport in the plant is vulnerable to desiccation-induced changes, including vascular tissue embolism (i.e. air bubble formation).  The overall objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms responsible for prevention of hydraulic failure (i.e. catastrophic embolism) in tree seedlings, thereby ensuring adequate photosynthesis for their survival and establishment.  Survival, growth, physiology and anatomy of growing seedlings will be measured to assess desiccation tolerance and the impacts of drying on photosynthesis, and to determine when structures that regulate seedling water loss develop.  Results from this research can be directly used in modeled predictions of vegetation responses to climate change because seedling survival is likely a primary determinant of species distributions.  These findings will also be of interest to policy makers and land managers who are interested in potential drought impacts on productivity and distributions of certain species.  They will also be of interest to tree and woody crop breeders concerned with identifying traits associated with survival and adequate productivity in given environments.  In addition, the ideas and methodology of measuring young seedling hydraulic parameters will be of interest to the plant science community and could provide a springboard for a new area of research activity.

This has resulted in some intersting and surprising findings. Young seedlings differ in drought tolerance compared to adults of the same species. In more mesic species, seedlings appear to be less drought tolerant than adults but the opposite is true in more arid species. Also, young seedlings have greater water transport capacity on a per-area basis than adults of the same species.   We have used microCT (CAT scan technology) and confocal imaging methods to view seedling vascular tissues in 3 dimensions, both through time as they develop, and during drought. We have learned that newly germinated seedlings transport water through multiple tissues, including parencyma, pith and xylem and that during drought-induced hydraulic failure, water flow through the parenchyma is disrupted but not throught the xylem. We have also found that in newly-germinated conifers torus-margo pits are evident even in the first xylem cells to develop.   We have also emarked on a series of studies on seedling respones to fire and drought. Based on our first 2 experiemnts (fire alone and fire and drought combined), we have found that seedlings appear to die from insuffient carbon (i.e. starvation) after fire. Stored carbon is used for construction of new tissue and depending on the fire dose/intensity, seedlings either survive (low dose) or die within weeks even after investing in new leaf tissue. There is a dose threshold for mortality of ~1.2 MJ m-2, which is much greater than a fire with a fuel of dry pine needles (~0.5 MJ m-2).  All of these data, taken together, have provided novel insight into the biology of young seedlings that was not available before this project.

"This doctoral dissertation research project will enhance existing and develop new vulnerability and resilience assessment methods to assist stakeholders in increasing their resilience in coastal areas by targeting hazard mitigation to areas identified as most critical.  The project will advance vulnerability and resilience science by incorporating theoretical perspectives from political economy, political ecology, social theory, and resilience theory into what has predominately been an applied science field.  The project will provide new understanding regarding how social conditions, such as poverty, influence or predispose individuals to being more or less vulnerable or resilient to hazardous events. The project also will seek to identify the most effective scale for conducting vulnerability assessments for use in community-level hazard mitigation and planning.  The hazard exposure outputs generated during the conduct of this project will be used as inputs in a spatially explicit resilience and vulnerability model to measure community resilience and vulnerability at the sub-county level.  The results from this model will be distributed to communities within the study county as a resource for the development and implementation of mitigation and adaptation strategies that communities can feasibly implement to facilitate resilient development.  Although the project will be conducted in Sarasota County, Florida, project results will have utility in a much broader range of coastal settings.  The theoretical framework, models, and methods developed during the conduct of this project will provide communities with higher-resolution modeling methods and outputs for community-level hazard, vulnerability, and resilience assessment.  This project also has the potential to identify mitigation strategies that more specifically assist the marginalized population through development and targeting of non-structural mitigation policies that historically have been underutilized even though they more directly benefit many areas of communities where vulnerability is highest.  These adaptive strategies could facilitate recovery, especially in communities where hazard exposure is difficult to mitigate.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>This project will draw on a theoretical framework that integrates physical hazards models with social science models to improve existing vulnerability and resilience science methods.  The doctoral student will use geophysical hazard exposure modeling and social science measures to estimate community vulnerability and to identify areas of potential for enhancing resilience.  She will develop measures of the extent of higher-resolution hazards, which will be incorporated into the spatially explicit resilience and vulnerability model to better determine where hazards impacts are more likely to occur within a community.  In addition to conducting measurements of conditions that affect the threat of hazards in different locales and their incorporation with her data into the spatially explicit resilience and vulnerability model, the student will engages in meetings with stakeholders to determine external indicators that occur outside of the county, such as federal relief funding and state programs, as well as risk-perception indicators that influence overall vulnerability.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.075,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,15829.00,15829,4900,Geography and Spatial Sciences,1434315,,Raymond J Dezzani,McClure Hall 203,Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443021,dezzani@uidaho.edu,Raymond,Dezzani,,Thomas Baerwald,,['01001415DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],06/28/2014,08/01/2014,07/31/2017,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Development of a Spatially Explicit Resilience and Vulnerability Model Through Integration of Modeling and Stakeholder Perspectives,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Courtney Thompson'],J,," The overall goal of this research was to develop new methods for measuring vulnerability to natural hazards that advance the discipline and analyze how social conditions, social structure, and risk perception might influence vulnerability at the community level. This research addressed the following questions: 1) How can social theory be included in natural hazards and vulnerability frameworks to better represent how natural hazards impact social and physical systems? 2) How can we develop models that more accurately measure overall community vulnerability to hurricane storm surge inundation using multiscalar and spatially explicit vulnerability indicators for Sarasota County, FL? and 3) How can we examine and quantitatively measure the influence of risk perception, social agency and community involvement on overall vulnerability?  To answer the first question, this research examined theoretical gaps in natural hazards literature and vulnerability/resilience assessment methods and identified alternative theories outside of geography that may help researchers better explain existing patterns of vulnerability. Using this information, the researchers developed the INjecting Structuration into Resilience/Vulnerability STudies (INSeRT) conceptual framework, which reflects the segregated and hierarchical nature of a human-environment system. This framework was then used to guide the methodologies used to answer the second and third questions.  To answer the second question, researchers developed a hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM) that uses spatial, data collected at multiple scales (in this case, census data levels) to measure storm surge inundation vulnerability of a human environment system. A series of classical (OLS) and spatial (SAR, HGLM) regression models used traditional vulnerability indicators to determine what statistical method had the greatest explanatory power for modeling overall vulnerability. The results in Figure 1 indicate that the HGLM had the highest explanatory power for measuring vulnerability and also suggests that the effect of certain variables is spatially and scalar dependent. This result provides evidence that examining vulnerability from a multiscalar perspective results in more accurate information about system vulnerability. Researchers addressed the third question by developing, implementing and analyzing surveys that captured information about basic demographics, risk perception, and social agency factors. The survey data was analyzed for statistically significant relationships between these three characteristics using contingency table and correspondence analyses (Figures 2 and 3), whose results demonstrate that there is interdependence between these three social characteristics, but the degree of interdependence varies between demographic responses.    In terms of intellectual merit, this research advances vulnerability and resilience science by incorporating theory into what has predominately been an applied science field. The project examines social vulnerability from a political economy, social theory and resilience theory perspective and incorporating those concepts into the INSeRT framework. The INSeRT framework provides a systems-based vulnerability assessment framework that demonstrates how both the built/human and natural environment are impacted by natural hazards. The hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM) also serves as an improvement on existing vulnerability/resilience assessment methods as it offers information about how multiscalar indicators influence vulnerability and interact with one another within and across space and data scales, something that current vulnerability indices and quantification methods do not consider. Finally, through surveys, contingency tables and correspondence analysis, this validation methodology statistically measures the relationship between risk perception, levels of agency and basic demographic data. This research provides a measurable link between social structures, risk perception and demographics that can be used to enhance existing vulnerability/resilience assessments to provide a holistic measure of vulnerability.  The broader impacts from this project include the enhancement of existing vulnerability modeling through HGLM modeling, whose results for various inundation scenarios demonstrate that physical and socioeconomic variables influence overall vulnerability in a heterogeneous spatial and scalar manner. The HGLM has the potential to help communities identify mitigation techniques that can better assist marginalized populations through the development and targeting of non-structural mitigation policies that historically are underutilized even though they more directly benefit many areas of communities where vulnerability is highest. This information is critical for guiding mitigation and adaption planning toward higher vulnerability areas and underlying social processes in order to decrease overall vulnerability. The risk perception surveys also contribute to broader impacts, as survey analysis results can help communities identify mitigation techniques aimed at helping marginalized populations who may be unable (or feel unable) to engage in risk reduction behavior. Developing mitigation policies that benefit areas where vulnerability is highest but perceived community involvement and agency are low  would allow decision makers to target assistance to these populations. The resulting data and analysis for this project has also resulted in a doctoral dissertation and 2 presentations at the Annual American Association of Geographers conferences. Results of this project will also be disseminated as published papers and will be distributed to communities within Sarasota County, FL as a resource for the development and implementation of mitigation and adaptation strategies that communities can feasibly implement to facilitate resilient development.

"In harmonic analysis, frames provide decompositions of functions where the individual components (of the frame) are not necessarily linearly independent. In recent years, they have become the standard tool for generating useful redundant (or over complete) signal representations. Frames make signal representations more flexible, robust to transmission errors, and resilient to noise. Despite the prevalence of stochastic models for noise and other uncertainties that plague many signal processing problems, deterministic perspectives and methods remain dominant in frame theory research. <br/><br/>The pervasive theme of this research is to study how well (stochastic) signals can be represented by random subframes of standard ones. The ultimate goal is to design/study frames and random sub-frames that are resilient to transmission losses or erasures of frame coefficients. This will entail developing notions of optimality under erasure and characterizations of optimal frames. The application of this theoretical work to signal processing problems will promote the transition of basic mathematical results into applications and perhaps ultimately into new technologies. Since the proposed study lies in the interface of many mathematical sub-disciplines including harmonic analysis, and probability theory, it will also enable dissemination of mathematical knowledge across sub-disciplines and will foster an instructional agenda that embraces this cross-disciplinary view. Elements of the proposed research will be incorporated into a newly developed course (by PI) in approximation theory at the University of Idaho, as well as, student research activities.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.070,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,257190.00,257190,4900,Comm & Information Foundations,1422252,,Somantika Datta,"875 Perimeter Dr, MS 3020",Moscow,US,ID00,University of Idaho,ID,838443020,sdatta@uidaho.edu,Somantika,Datta,pregalia@nsf.gov,Phillip Regalia,7032922981,['01001415DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],06/18/2014,07/01/2014,06/30/2018,CIF: Small: Stochastic frames in signal processing,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,"['Numerical Functional Analysis and Optimization~2016~37~S.

The focus was on using stochastic models where, for example, the signal is a random signal drawn from some known distribution or the probability of a certain signal component being lost is known. The work done on the project has provided characterizations of the structure of optimal frames in such stochastic settings. It was previously known that special frames called equiangular tight frames are optimal in the face of erasures for deterministic signals, however, these are rare and hard to construct. Part of the outcome in the study of optimal frames includes generalizations and approximations of equiangular tight frames.    The mathematical results obtained in the study of optimal frames in dealing with signal processing problems, as described above, has promoted the transition of basic mathematics into applications. Further, the study was at the interface of several mathematical sub-disciplines like harmonic analysis, linear algebra, probability, and approximation theory, and has therefore expanded the knowledge of the interplay between sub-disciplines. The project also provided valuable opportunities for student research including a doctoral dissertation based on work done in this project that was supervised by the PI.

"Amphibians around the world are disappearing at an alarming rate. Many recent declines have been caused by a deadly chytrid fungus called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Bd has recently spread around the world and infects hundreds of amphibian species. This project focuses on understanding the interaction between the Bd pathogen and its amphibian hosts. Specifically the investigators will learn 1) why some amphibian species are devastated by Bd while others are not harmed and 2) why some strains of Bd are more deadly than others. The investigators will conduct an integrative and worldwide study of numerous Bd isolates and a diversity of frog species. Results from this project will help guide conservation efforts be targeted to the most vulnerable species and to areas where Bd will have the most devastating impact. Further the general understanding of host-pathogen interactions resulting from this project can be applied to other systems where wildlife are threatened with new emerging diseases. The project also provides training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, with a focus on broadening participation of underrepresented groups. In addition to scientific research, the project will provides education about biodiversity and conservation to the public and local public elementary school children through popular press publications, museum exhibits, and an outreach event called ""Save the Frogs Day"". <br/><br/>The researchers in this project have taken genetic, genomic, immunological, and organismal approaches to accomplish their objectives. First, they will use a comparative approach to identify genomic variations in 60 Bd isolates gathered from around the world that vary in infectivity towards various amphibian hosts. Second, they will study variations in in vitro growth phenotypes that they propose directly relate to infectivity. Last, they will examine in vivo and cell culture-based phenotypes, in parallel with host tissue profiling. A key aspect of the third goal is that the applicants have selected 6 congeneric amphibian host pairs (2 species in each of three different genera) that vary in susceptibility to Bd. They will utilize Illumina-based sequencing techniques to obtain genome-wide association studies of the phenotypes of interest. In vivo infection phenotypes such as Bd burden under the common garden conditions tested will be coupled with transcriptomic analysis of host gene expression to evaluate differential responses by susceptible/tolerant hosts.

"Central Asia is highly dependent on glacier meltwater for its water resources. Its high mountains hold great volumes of glacial ice, with seasonal snow melt supplying up to 80% of the region's fresh water needs. However, since the 1960s, central Asia has lost over 14% of its glacier covered area and ~18% of its ice volume. Changes in glacially-fed hydrologic systems impact water availability and biodiversity in these regions. However, these observations cover only a fraction of the climate history of this region. Ice cores from glaciers in the high Himalayas preserve records of millennia of climate changes. Understanding the natural variability recorded in such records is of critical importance for interpreting the vulnerability of the region to modern and future climate change.<br/><br/>This project will recover a surface-to-bedrock ice core from the Pamir, Tajikistan, which will be used to develop detailed records of climate changes in central Asia during the Holocene and beyond. The results will be used to reconstruct the dynamics and rates of moderate, abrupt, and threshold changes in climate in Central Asia. Specifically, the research team will generate annually-resolved, multivariate geochemical records from the ice cores (including stable isotopes, trace elements, major ions, and dust particles), recover pollen and other biological materials, and compare the results with ice core and other paleo records from the interior of Asia. Chronological control will be established with a variety of techniques (layer counting, radiocarbon, beryllium-10, lead-210, and tritium). The project involves scientific collaboratio with international research partners from Germany and Japan as well as from local government departments in Tajikistan. Graduate students from two US institutions would be involved in the international activities, which will include both field expeditions to collect the ice cores and follow up sampling and collaboration visits.<br/><br/>This project is jointly supported by the Paleoclimate Program of the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences, the EPSCoR program, and the Division of International Science and Engineering.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,890877.00,890877,4900,Paleoclimate,1401826,,Vladimir B Aizen,"McClure Hall 203, PO Box 443021",Moscow,US,"ID""","Department of Geography, University of Idaho",ID,838443021,aizen@uidaho.edu,Vladimir,Aizen,dverardo@nsf.gov,David Verardo,7032924695,"['01001415DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001516DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001617DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",06/12/2014,06/01/2014,05/31/2019,Collaborative Research:  P2C2--Pleistocene/Holocene Climate Reconstruction from a Pamir High Resolution Deep Ice-Core,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Elena M Aizen'],B,"['Journal of Glaciology~2014~60~Lambrecht, A., C.

Six deep ice cores (from the surface to bedrock, Fig 1) with over 12,000 of years of climate records were recovered from glaciers in Central Asia. Our studies have shown that most glaciers in Pamir, Tien Shan, and Siberian Altai at altitudes up to 5000-5500 m retreated or completely melted after the Last Glacial Maximum during the B?lling-Aller?d and regenerated during the Younger Dryas (8.2ka cooling episode) and Severe Centennial Drought Period. .  The annual and seasonal variability of in climate in different regions of Pamir, at different elevations were assessed based on data from local meteorological stations operated since middle of last century. Combination of meteorological and synoptic data and ice-core isotope-chemistry climatic records are the base for paleoclimatic reconstructions in central Asia. to understand the variability of climate and water resources in one of the most arid regions of the World. Changes in major atmospheric circulation over the Globe contributed to the changes in snow isotope-chemistry, which reflected in deep ice-cores recovered at high alpine glaciers. The analysis of this records will allow us to understand the variability of climate and water resources for future generations.       Last Modified: 09/26/2019       Submitted by: Vladimir B Aizen"
"Many genes control organismal traits and these genes interact in complex ways. This project focuses on two types of gene interactions - physical and epistatic (gene-by-gene) - and how their contribution shapes biological diversity. First, genes are physically located along chromosomes so that the action of genetic recombination, mutation and selection on a focal gene affects expressed variation at nearby genes. Second, genes may interact with one another through common genetic pathways. We will evolve experimental populations of yeast in the laboratory under different environmental conditions, and then genetically sequence the populations to test a prevailing model of genetic evolution. We will also use computer simulation models of evolving genetic networks to identify how epistatic interactions affect adaptation to changing environmental pressures. Lastly, we will examine the joint effect of these two types of interactions on genetic diversity in the experimental yeast system.<br/><br/>This research will train a graduate student in genomics and experimental evolution, with mentorship toward a research career. Furthermore, we will create an educational webpage available to the public, aimed at high school biology students, that will interactively show how the complex interaction of various genetic and environmental processes shape biological diversity.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,18823.00,18823,4900,EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS,1406762,,Paul A Hohenlohe,,,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443051,hohenlohe@uidaho.edu,Paul,Hohenlohe,sscheine@nsf.gov,Samuel Scheiner,7032927175,['01001415DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],04/08/2014,06/01/2014,05/31/2016,Dissertation Research: The role of genetic interactions in adaptation,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Tyler Hether'],A,," In this project we investigated the role of genetic interactions in evolutionary adaptation from two perspectives.  First, genes exist not as isolated entities, but rather linked together on chromosomes.  As a result, natural selection acting on one gene can have strong effects on others in the chromosomal neighborhood, which can have profound consequences for the patterns of genetic variation and evolution.  We focused on the case of two populations evolving in different environments, thus facing divergent selection pressures, but exchanging migrants between them.  A common prediction in this case is that the chromosomal neighborhoods around genes under selection will show higher levels of genetic differentiation between the two populations, a pattern called a ""genomic island of divergence.""  We developed an experimental system using laboratory populations of yeast in which we could control the factors of selection, migration, population size, and rate of sexual reproduction in a replicated experimental design, and apply next-generation DNA sequencing to study the resulting genetic patterns.  We confirmed that genomic islands of divergence can form under experimental conditions, and that as expected they depend on other factors like rate of migration between populations.  Surprisingly, we found a high level of stochasticity -- random variation in the patterns of genetic differences between populations -- in the cases when sexual reproduction took place, compared to solely asexual populations.  Our results highlight the importance of migration and sexual reproduction for creating new combinations of genetic variants, and the complex consequences of this genetic re-sorting for adaptation to environmental conditions.  Second, we examined another type of interaction between genes -- the regulation of gene expression, or the amount of protein that is produced.  We built a simple network model of gene regulation, with just two genes, each of which may be influenced by the other.  We used simulation modeling to study the effect of this simple regulatory network on adaptation and found several surprising results.  First, we discovered a tortoise-hare pattern in which some populations exhibited an initial jump toward a selective optimum but then stalled, while other populations marched more slowly but steadily toward the optimum, eventually outperforming the others.  This pattern resulted from the different types of mutations that can occur in the simple network model, and the consequences of these mutations for future adaptation.  Second, we found that even with two populations evolving under identical conditions, populations can randomly end up on different adaptive paths that result in reproductive isolation between populations.  Thus even simple genetic networks may play a key role in the process of speciation.  This project provided mentorship and training to a graduate student, who successfully defended his Ph.D. during the course of the grant and has moved on to a postdoctoral research position.  He gained experience in conducting independent research projects, presenting results and writing scientific manuscripts, and mentoring other members of the research lab.  We continue to disseminate the results from this project: as part of the experimental evolution work, we produced a freely available software package, written in the language R, for estimating recombination rate in yeast.  A manuscript evaluating the performance of this approach and testing multiple DNA sequencing approaches is currently in the revision stage of the peer-review process.  A manuscript describing the genetic regulatory network model will be submitted for publication in September 2016, and an additional manuscript describing the experimental genomic island results is in preparation.  Our results have also been presented to the scientific community in local and regional scientific meetings.          Last Modified: 09/01/2016       Submitted by: Paul A Hohenlohe"
"Collaborative Research: Understanding the role of hyporheic processes on nitrous oxide emissions at the stream network scale <br/><br/>Field evidence confirms that stream processing of reactive nitrogen (Nr), primarily ammonium and nitrate, is a potentially important source of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Stream emissions may account for up to 10% of global anthropogenic N2O production and N2O has 310 times more warming potential per unit weight than carbon dioxide. In streams, the production of N2O occurs primarily in streambed sediments, and the mass transport of reactive species, i.e., dissolved oxygen, Nr, and organic carbon, via hyporheic flow strongly influences reaction rates, residence times, and subsequent N2O emissions. Previous research has shown a strong interaction between hydraulics in the hyporheic zone (HZ) and streambed morphology. The project couples a novel Lagrangian modeling approach based on residence time distributions differentiated for channel reach types and local hyporheic components of the stream network with seasonal synoptic sampling in two watersheds with contrasting land use. <br/><br/>Improved understanding of watershed and network scale controls on potent greenhouse gas emissions will be societally-relevant to policy makers addressing elevated Nr concentrations in surface waters. Research results will be applicable to land use management, non-point source pollution, and river restoration projects. The products from this research will provide a model for estimating the fate of Nr at the stream network scale, offer a new understanding of the role of HZ at the stream network scale, and clarify the effect of stream network structure and stream morphology on HZ processes. Results from this research can be extended to study transport of other solutes and pathogens along streams. With the advance in remote sensing and GIS tools, data for this approach will be more readily available and thus applicable to provide predictions when minimal field survey data are available.

A portion of it flows beneath and besides the stream and river reaches in the so-called hyporheic zone (HZ). Along with the benthic zone, this band of surface-water saturated sediments has been suggested as a hot spot for biogeochemical reactions occurring in streams and rivers. One of the most important transformations is that of nitrogen, whose concentrations have been increasing in aquatic systems since the green revolution.  Reactive nitrogen is a significant source of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Emissions of N2O from streams and rivers potentially are up to 0.7 Tg y-1, equivalent to 10% of global anthropogenic N2O emissions. Its production mainly occurs via microbially-mediated denitrification that transforms nitrate to the nitrogenous gasses di-nitrogen gas (N2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). It has been suggested that HZ may be the key source of N2O in riverine systems because it has both oxic and anoxic conditions. The latter is a necessary condition for denitrification to occur. However, we do not have a conceptual and predictive model to characterize which reaches of a riverine network emit N2O and which portion of the reach, among hyporheic zone, benthic zone and water column, is the main contributor of those emissions. Thus, the goal of this research was to understand and quantify the role of hyporheic processes on nitrous oxide emissions at the stream network scale for different land-use and land cover, biomes, stream and river size, season and climatic conditions.    To address this goal, this research used a series of synoptic field sampling surveys, synthesis of previous published data and numerical modeling. The synoptic sampling campaigns were in the fall, winter, spring and summer seasons in two contrasting river basins: the Manistee R. Basin (MI, 83% forested) and the Tippecanoe R. Basin (IN, 82% row-crop agriculture). On each sampling date, water samples for inorganic nutrients (nitrate, ammonium, soluble reactive phosphorus) and dissolved greenhouse gasses (nitrous oxide: N2O, carbon dioxide: CO2 and methane: CH4) were collected along with physical site descriptors (flow depth width, velocity and temperature and type of substrate) at 80 sites in each basin over the course of 24hrs. These data were augmented with a meta-analysis from data available in the literature from the LINXII streams (USA), the Kalamazoo River (MI, USA) and the Swale-Ouse River (a mid-sized UK river), six large river networks in Africa (Congo, Ati-Galana-Sabaki, Betsiboka, Rianila, Tana and Zambezi) and in the tidal section of the Hudson River (NJ, USA). The analysis of these data allowed the identification of a new dimensionless scaling framework. This framework shows that the dimensionless N2O emissions, F*N2O, (ratio between N2O fluxes and loads of nitrate and ammonium) depend on the benthic-hyporheic Damk&ouml;hler number defined as the ratio between the hyporheic median residence time at the reach scale and time of denitrification in streams and on the stream Damk&ouml;hler number defined as the ratio between the vertical turbulence mixing time and the time of denitrification in rivers (Figure 1).   This research results confirm that emissions rate per unit area decreases from streams, which are defined as riverine systems with widths less than approximately 30m, toward rivers, systems with widths larger than 30 m (Figure 2). Hyporheic processes have a primary role on nitrous oxide, N2O, emissions from streams dominating that of benthic and water column production by 1 order of magnitude. However, it has a negligible effect in rivers (Figure 3). Land-use and land-cover have an important effect on N2O emissions because they affect: (1) stream hydrology, (2) morphology and (3) nitrate loads. Similarly, seasonality affects N2O production due to changes in hydraulics, water temperature and nutrient loads. Variations in stream hydraulics and nutrient loads are directly included in the characterization of both Damk&ouml;hler numbers and the dimensionless flux of N2O; whereas the effect of water temperature is modeled by scaling F*N2O with an Arrhenius type equation. The developed dimensionless framework captures both hyporheic and surface hydromorphological and biogeochemical processes to predict N2O emissions (Figure 4) during average flow conditions. The data analysis shows that it is a robust method, which only uses standard measurements including: reach scale water depth, width, velocity, temperature, substrate and bedform types and nitrate and ammonium concentration. This framework allows identifying the reaches, which are ""hot spots"" for N2O emissions, along riverine networks.       Last Modified: 07/31/2017       Submitted by: Daniele Tonina"
"Over the past two years members of the Bering Sea Sub-Network (BSSN, http://www.bssn.net/) have provided input and achieved consensus that BSSN needs to evolve toward a broader range of data for the purpose of developing more tangible metrics and guidelines for adaptation. This evolution, entitled the Community Observing Network for Adaptation and Security (CONAS) requires a bridging period of approximately one year.  The team will build off of the key elements of the BSSN data collection mechanisms but expand these to include more variables of interest and place them in a sociocultural context so that arctic communities and governments will be able to anticipate, plan and respond to these changes through the development of Adaptive Capacity Indices (ACIs).  A transition year will allow the research team and participating Bering Sea communities to plan for full implementation of CONAS.  CONAS will examine environmental change and response within a framework of social-ecological system (SES) science. In an SES context, the ability of a community to respond successfully to change is referred to as its adaptive capacity. Adaptive capacity reflects both the sensitivity of community members to their environment and their ability to institute changes that make them less vulnerable to a given perturbation (Ensor and Berger 2009, Wilkinson 2012).

The need for observational data remains high as we struggle to understand the suite of changes occurring in the Arctic and the consequences these may have to the communities who reside there, and to the communities of practice with interests there. This award focused on the scientific development and applicability of community-based observing networks and systems (CBONS) in the Arctic and the Bering Sea specifically. CBONS are partnerships with local communities to establish trained and vetted local observers who are experienced hunters and fishers, respected in their community as possessing a high degree of awareness and knowledge of the local marine environment. The observers in a CBONS provide a level of detail and local context that conventional observing buoys, stations, and aircraft cannot (Figure 1).  This project developed the Community Observing Network for Adaptation and Security (CONAS) as a CBONS operating across the Bering Sea in partnership with Inupiaq, Siberian Yupiq, Chukchi, and Aleut communities and observers (Figure 2). CONAS examined and documented environmental change in the Bering Sea (Table 1) and then used this as the basis for developing tools to further assist communities? responses to environmental change.  These tools include measures of vulnerability to environmental change along with measures of capacity to respond to change, also known as adaptive capacity indices.  Adaptive capacity reflects both the sensitivity of community members to their environment and their ability to institute responses that make them less vulnerable to ongoing or sudden changes.  The project leveraged the United States chairmanship of the Arctic Council (2015-2017) with outcomes from this project supporting the Arctic Adaptation Exchange portal (http://arcticadaptationexchange.com/) for disseminating results to communities, practitioners and scientists. The adaptive capacity tool was also made available via the Arctic Water Resources Vulnerability Index (http://awrvi.epscor.alaska.edu/).  CONAS has been a dynamic, adaptive network designed to collect diverse environmental variables at multiple time scales and locations, giving residents around the Bering Sea greater participation in tracking global change and its social consequences in order to enhance forecasting and decision support.

"Funds are provided to characterize the interactions among the atmospheric state, cloud properties, radiation, and precipitation at Summit, Greenland. The objective is to investigate a number of important cloud-related processes, how these interact with the Arctic climate system, and their impact on the surface energy and mass budgets. Specific foci will include:<br/>1) Low-cloud persistence mechanisms that lead to long-lived Arctic stratiform clouds, which interact strongly with the atmospheric structure and surface energy budget;<br/>2) Cloud-phase partitioning, which determines the cloud microphysical composition and, ultimately, the effects that clouds have on atmospheric radiation and the hydrologic cycle; and<br/>3) Precipitation partitioning, in order to understand the different modes of precipitation at Summit and how these impact the total surface accumulation.<br/>To address these topics, this project will utilize detailed observations from a suite of ground-based remote sensors deployed at Summit as part of the NSF/AON-funded ICECAPS project in combination with data from satellite-borne active remote sensors. High-resolution numerical modeling will also be used to investigate many of the fine-scale cloud processes and their mesoscale influences. These studies over the Greenland Ice Sheet will also be considered within the context of similar measurements and model studies made at other Arctic locations in order to understand these important processes over Summit and, in a more general sense, across the Arctic.<br/><br/>Atmospheric water vapor, clouds, and precipitation greatly affect the surface energy and cryospheric mass balances in the Arctic, and are responsible for much of the variability in these balances.

Cloud-related processes and feedbacks are known to be one of the greatest sources of uncertainty in global climate models, and these shortcomings have been clearly identified in model simulations over the Arctic.  Thus, the results of this project should improve our understanding of Arctic cloud processes and their inclusion in climate models, which, in turn, will improve predictability.<br/><br/> As broader impacts of this research, the project will provide important data analysis and integration experience for four new graduate students at the participating universities.

"The Learning Algebra and Methods for Proving (LAMP) project tests and refines a hypothetical learning trajectory and corresponding assessments, based on the collective work of 50 years of research in mathematics education and psychology, for improving students' ability to reason, prove, and argue mathematically in the context of algebra. The goals of LAMP are: 1) to produce a set of evidence-based curriculum materials for improving student learning of reasoning, proving, and argumentation in eighth-grade classrooms where algebra is taught; 2) to produce empirical evidence that forms the basis for scaling the project to a full research and development project; and 3) to refine a set of instruments and data collection methods to support a full research and development project. LAMP combines qualitative and quantitative methods to refine and test a hypothetical learning trajectory for learning methods of reasoning, argumentation, and proof in the context of eighth-grade algebra curricula. Using qualitative methods and quantitative methods, the project conducts a pilot study that can be scaled up in future studies. The study produces an evidence-based learning trajectory and appropriate instruments for assessing it. <br/>Over the past two decades, national organizations have called for more attention to the topics of proof, proving, and argumentation at all grade levels. However, the teaching of reasoning and proving remains sparse in classrooms at all levels. LAMP will address this critical need in STEM education by demonstrating ways to improve students' reasoning and argumentation skills to meet the demands of college and career readiness. <br/>This project promises to have broad impacts on future curricula in the United States by creating a detailed description of how to facilitate reasoning and argumentation learning in actual eighth-grade classrooms. At present, a comprehensive understanding of how reasoning and proving skills develop alongside algebraic thinking does not exist. Traditional, entirely formal approaches such as two-column proof have not demonstrated effectiveness in learning about proof and proving, nor in improving other mathematical practices such as problem-solving skills and sense making.

Similarly, within a school containing both a treatment and a comparison teacher, students receiving LAMP curriculum scored higher than those in the comparison group (t[107] = -3.34, p &lt; .001), Cohen?s d = .639.   State assessments provide a sub-score for students? ability to communicating reasoning, which is based on viable argument practices. Treatment students outperformed their peers who did not receive the LAMP intervention. A greater proportion of students in the treatment group were in higher mathematics levels (i.e., proficient, advanced) relative to their peers in the comparison group (_&chi;2(3) = 31.62, p &lt; .001). There were also differences in the distribution of student communicate reasoning sub-scores (&chi;2(2) = 5.88, p = .053) suggesting students receiving LAMP training may score higher on communicating reasoning scores. In the subsample from the school where both a treatment and a comparison teacher taught, students in the treatment group had mathematics level scores of 3 (proficient) or 4 (advanced) relative to their peers in the comparison class (&chi;2(3) = 10.99, p &lt; .05). There were trend level differences in the distribution of student sub-scores for communicating reasoning (_&chi;2(2) = 5.46, p = .065), suggesting students receiving LAMP training may score higher on communicating reasoning scores beyond effects of school context.   The LAMP project developed an argument and reasoning assessment to evaluate the interventions effects on student?s ability to construct and critique viable arguments. Results showed that treatment students made significant pre-post gains (t = 2.85, p &lt; .01) on this assessment and the comparison group did not (t = 1.62, p = 1.24). Within the school that housed both a treatment and comparison teacher, students receiving LAMP curriculum demonstrated significant gains in argumentation skills measured by the LAMP assessment (t = 5.76, p &lt; .01), while the comparison students? LAMP scores decreased significantly (t = - 5.19, p &lt; .01).     These positive results should be interpreted with caution. This was an exploratory study intended to provide evidence to warrant a large-scale study. Sample sizes are too small to be taken as a robust finding. However, the findings from this exploratory study are promising and compelling. The LAMP project provides evidence that the practice of teaching and learning content with and through argumentation contributes significantly to gains in student mathematics achievement.

"This workshop brings together scholars who are doing research that involves team-based, interdisciplinary, integrative research focused on the social sciences in collaboration with natural sciences and engineering. The purpose is to explore lessons learned from such research toward producing a report of best practices for integrating the social sciences with the biophysical sciences, mathematics, and engineering for sustainability science. The workshop explores what works, what doesn't work and why in order to engage these leaders in questions of how to best mentor emerging integrative scientists, to identify the key technologies which are critical to enabling integrative sustainability science and to provide structured guidance on how to integrate the social sciences in sustainability research and education. These best practices are directed at diverse audiences ranging from NSF and other funding program decision makers to researchers and education experts engaged in sustainability programs.<br/><br/>Sustainability science encompasses a myriad range of issues and processes that involve diverse aspects of the natural world and the societies that are part of it. It is only through an understanding of these latter phenomena that likely solutions will be derived. Moreover, the approaches to sustainability science have to address the multitude of worldviews and values that comprise the roots of the many challenges we currently face. To date, no meeting has occurred in the Americas to clearly articulate what has become an overwhelming call to find effective and powerful ways to incorporate the social sciences, and an understanding of social dynamics, into sustainability science. <br/><br/>To achieve sustainability, decision makers must learn to integrate knowledge and methods from the natural sciences, engineering, and the social sciences. Solutions are neither purely technical nor socio-economic, but involve bringing together best practices from all fields.

Throughout history human societies have faced a changing world. However, we live in an era where the combined influences of increased climate variability, population pressures, globalization, environmental change and the need for a new paradigm of built and engineered environments now challenges us to adapt. In response to this, several research communities have refocused their efforts toward ""interdisciplinary science"" and, more specifically, sustainability science. These efforts attempt to build Concurrently, agencies and governments have allocated billions of dollars to research and development to meet these adaptation goals. However, while the concept of integration appears intuitive, after all we know our world is complicated, inter-connected and emergent, the practice of its science has been elusive, resulting in æhit and missÆ outcomes and thus, uncertain returns on research and development investments.  Addressing these core issues hinges on successful integration: across concepts, datasets and approaches. Implicit in this integration is the engagement of communities that have historically been omitted from the process of science, such as policy makers and the public at large. Underlying this is a re-examination of how we æteachÆ scholarship and how we mentor upcoming generations in their learning. However, no collectively synthesized best practices or ætoolboxÆ exists.  In response to this critical gap 35 of the countryÆs leading integrative scientists came together in October 2012 to develop an initial set of key challenges related to integrating the social sciences into sustainability research. Following a series of smaller, targeted discussions during 2014 and 2015 a ""Best Practices"" report was drafted, reviewed, edited and published. Key findings include:     Integrated natural and social science research necessitates the growth of a community of practice that is built on:  1)    common data formats and workflows.  2)    transparent, well-documented, and replicable methods.  3)    a common language and set of concepts about coupled natural-human systems.     Effective integrated natural and social science research will require innovative approaches for how we do integrated science that is based on the co-production of knowledge and reflects:  1)    the multi-disciplinary nature of sustainability problems  2)    variation in spatial and temporal scales in coupled natural human systems  3)    the contested nature of the questions and solutions     Establishing an enduring integrative science will require:  1)    Formation and maintenance of interdisciplinary teams  2)    Use of methods that facilitate collaborative research  3)    Explicit program for training the next generation of sustainability scientists  4)    Co-production of knowledge with stakeholders and decision-makers     Managing and adapting to change in coupled natural human systems is essential for integrated research. This requires:  1)    Anticipation of system-level consequences of social decisions  2)    Identification of diverse strategies for adapting and mitigating the impacts of system-level change  3)    Application of scenario development and modeling to understand possible future states  4)    Communication and dissemination of integrated science knowledge                Last Modified: 07/18/2015       Submitted by: Andrew D Kliskey"

"This project is an effort to constrain the surface and atmospheric composition of Saturn's moon Titan. Spectroscopic observations of the surface, whether from in situ spacecraft or Earth-based telescopes, are complicated by Titan's thick atmosphere, through which the light must traverse, and the composition and structure of which are poorly known. The key element of this project is the observation of a grazing-angle specular reflection of the Sun from one of Titan's hydrocarbon lakes by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) on the Cassini spacecraft. The Principal Investigator (PI) intends to exploit the wavelength independence of the specular reflection to isolate the atmospheric contributions to the total spectrum. The proposed work consists of three specific tasks: (1) to explore the composition of Titan's polar atmosphere using the transmission spectrum obtained from the specular reflection; (2) to constrain the composition of possible surface organic species using VIMS spectra in the 5-micron transmission window corrected for atmospheric effects, and (3) to map the extent of surface water ice exposures using the corrected spectra. The project would support the work of a graduate student and an undergraduate student at an institution that has not previously been active in astronomy research, providing an opportunity to broaden participation in science among residents of Idaho.

The Cassini spacecraft discovered specular reflections -- sunglints -- off of the methane/ethane lakes that reside in Titan's north polar arctic.  These glints are super-bright when viewed from nearby.  In fact they are so bright that they can be used to probe the entire atmospheric column of Titan's dense, extended atmosphere.  We found that Titan's atmosphere is much more highly absorbing at 2.7um than it is at 2.8um. Because solar occultation observations, which probe down only to the tropopause at ~40km altitude on Titan, do not see this 2.7um absorber, we suspect that it could owe to either ethane or CH_3D located preferentially at lower altitudes and in particular over lakes.  We also developed a new radiative transfer model, SRTC++, whose source code has been posted to GitHub for general availability.

"As the Earth's climate warms over the next century, ecosystems throughout the northern hemisphere will be exposed to elevated rates of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition.  Understanding this complex environmental change lies at the heart of our ability to anticipate the degree to which forests will sequester human-produced carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  An interdisciplinary team of scientists will investigate the interaction between climate warming and simulated atmospheric N deposition using a long-term, regional-based, field experiment located in a sugar maple-dominated forest ecosystem common over eastern North America.  During the past 18 years, simulated atmospheric nitrogen deposition at rates expected to occur by 2050 have increased tree growth and slowed the decay of dead leaves and roots, increasing the amount of carbon stored in this wide-spread ecosystem.  However, it is uncertain whether carbon storage will attain a higher equilibrium over the long-term as atmospheric nitrogen deposition increases or whether expected warming will counteract this effect.  The proposed research will quantify the amounts of carbon stored in overstory trees, forest floor and soil over the next decade, allowing this team of scientists to test hypotheses regarding the interaction of climate warming and atmospheric nitrogen deposition on ecosystem carbon sequestration.<br/><br/>Using NSF support, this team will continue conducting the annual Global Change Teachers Institute.

This collaborative LTREB project was designed to advance our understanding of how elevated nitrogen deposition affects forest ecosystem carbon storage.  As a part of the work supported by this NSF award, our lab at the University of Idaho investigated the effects of long-term experimental nitrogen deposition on the decomposition of plant debris (leaf litter and fine roots) and aimed to develop a mechanistic understanding of these effects.  We found that experimental nitrogen deposition stimulated early-stage decomposition of leaf litter, while it slowed fine root decomposition.  This slower decomposition of fine roots was estimated to explain 5-51% of the previously documented soil carbon accumulation under experimental nitrogen deposition.  Although previous nitrogen deposition studies have focused on leaf litter, our work suggests that slower fine root decomposition is a major driver of soil organic carbon accumulation under elevated nitrogen deposition.  Our chemical analysis reveals that this slower fine root decomposition can be largely explained by the suppression of degradation of lignin, a chemical class that is highly abundant in fine roots.  Our chemical data suggest that decomposition of chemical classes subject to oxidative degradation, such as lignin and condensed tannins, is generally inhibited by nitrogen enrichment of soil, but whether this inhibition eventually slows mass loss and leads to organic matter accumulation depends on the initial quantities of these chemical classes in litter materials.  Most earth system models do not include nitrogen interactions with soil carbon storage, with a few using nitrogen limitations on decomposition alone to represent nitrogen-carbon coupling.  Our work and other studies from this collaborative LTREB project demonstrated the need for a more comprehensive nitrogen-carbon interaction framework that takes into account the potential suppression of litter decomposition and the accumulation of soil organic carbon in the scenario of continuously increasing atmospheric nitrogen deposition.  For the purpose of disseminating the findings of this project, our lab has been maintaining a project website (http://webpages.uidaho.edu/nitrogen-gradient/) dedicated to sharing our long-term data and publications with members of the scientific community as well as the general public.

"Because of the slow pace of terrestrial ecosystem processes, including the slow generation time, growth rate, and decomposition rate of trees, the impact of changing climate and disturbance on forests plays out over hundreds of years. For this reason, terrestrial ecosystem models are used to anticipate the centennial scale projections of forest response to environmental change. Current terrestrial ecosystem model predictions vary widely and results have large statistical uncertainties. Furthermore, testing and calibration of these models relies on short term (sub-daily to decadal) data that fail to capture longer term trends and infrequent extreme events. The capacity of ecosystem models for scientific inference and long-term prediction would be greatly improved if uncertainties can be reduced through rigorous testing against observational data. PalEON is an interdisciplinary team of paleoecologists, statisticians, and modelers that have partnered to rigorously synthesize longer term paleoecological data and incorporate into ecosystem models to provide a deeper understanding of past dynamics and to use this knowledge to improve long-term forecasting capabilities.<br/><br/>Funds are provided to address four objectives and associated research questions: 1) Validation: How well do ecosystem models simulate decadal-to-centennial dynamics when confronted with past climate change, and what limits model accuracy? 2) Initialization: How sensitive are ecosystem models to initialization state and equilibrium assumptions? Do data-constrained simulations of centennial-scale dynamics improve 20thcentury simulations? 3) Inference: Was the terrestrial biosphere a carbon sink or source during the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climate Anomaly? and 4) Improvement: How can parameters and processes responsible for data-model divergences be improved? The data synthesis will include wide range of ecosystems, encompasses past climate variations that were large enough to affect tree growth rates, disturbance regimes, and forest demography, and leverages available paleodata. The synthesis will include 1) fossil pollen and Public Land Survey data to reconstruct forest composition, 2) sedimentary charcoal, stand-age and firescar indicators of past disturbance regimes, 3) tree-ring records of tree growth rates, and 4) multiple paleoclimatic proxies and paleoclimatic simulations. Bayesian hierarchical statistical models will be used to reconstruct key ecological variables and their associated uncertainty estimates. A standardized model intercomparison involving 13 ecosystem modeling groups will be used to evaluate the robustness of the modeling approach.<br/><br/>Three areas will be emphasized for PalEON's broader impacts. Community Building: The PalEON research community has doubled over the past 10 months, with more than 60 participants now. It is anticipated to nearly another doubling over the next five years, and the funds will allow the ongoing community-building via annual large meetings and task-oriented workshops. Interdisciplinary Training and Mentoring: A new generation of researchers will be trained to naturally conceptualize large spatial and temporal scales and to approach ecological forecasting as an integrative activity spanning data collection to model prediction. Eight postdocs and seven graduate students will be involved in proposed PalEON research, with multiple opportunities for cross-training. Additionally, the PalEON Summer Short Course provides an intensive cross-training experience for young scientists in all areas encompassed by PalEON.

"Mechanisms responsible for observed and projected hydrologic change in high-elevation catchments are poorly understood, especially with respect to snowpack dynamics, surface-water/groundwater linkages, and interactions with vegetation. Idaho, Nevada, and New Mexico envision a Western Consortium for Watershed Analysis, Visualization, and Exploration (WC-WAVE) whose overarching goal is to advance watershed science, workforce development, and education with cyberinfrastructure (CI)-enabled discovery and innovation. WC-WAVE has three integrated components, with associated goals and approaches:<br/><br/>1. Watershed Science: Advance understanding of hydrologic interactions and their impact on ecosystem services using a virtual watershed (VW) framework. Watershed scientists and students parameterize, run, validate, and integrate watershed models; specify VW user requirements; and provide feedback on the evolving CI platform.<br/><br/>2. Visualization and Data CI: Accelerate collaborative, interdisciplinary watershed research and discovery through innovative visualization environments and through streamlined data management, discovery, and access. The CI team develops, tests, deploys and integrates the VW data and service platform components. CI advancements provide a user-friendly VW platform that supports advanced analysis, modeling, and visualization activities and is based on robust CI that enables data preservation, data assimilation, and data and model interoperability.<br/><br/>3. Workforce Development and Education: Engage university faculty and graduate students in interdisciplinary team-based watershed research, and broaden undergraduate student participation in STEM through modeling and visualization. The Consortium supports: graduate workforce development through a series of institutes and research activities that provide interdisciplinary training and workforce preparation; and two cohorts of diverse undergraduates and their faculty mentors that acquire and use skills in modeling and visualization to create education modules that can be incorporated into curricula.<br/><br/>WC-WAVE collaborations and impacts are sustained beyond the award via collaborative research projects; incorporation of data and models in open-community-based data centers and code repositories; and CI adoption by State programs.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Mountain watersheds provide a large proportion of water and ecosystem services to communities in the intermountain west. Climate change impacts affect the ability of watersheds to provide hydrological services such as water storage, flow moderation, and water quality improvement. Interactions among precipitation, vegetation growth, fire regime, soil moisture, runoff, and other landscape properties create systems in which even subtle changes in climate may lead to complex responses and cascading impacts. Integration of creative observation and analytical strategies using advanced modeling approaches and CI made possible in a virtual watershed framework is critical to understanding and predicting complex responses to climate and hydrologic change. WC-WAVE CI enables increased understanding of watershed dynamics in the western US by allowing researchers to: easily acquire and integrate data, use an integrated suite of models to discover processes linking components of the hydrologic cycle, to identify environmental consequences of hydrologic changes, and to visualize and interpret data and model results. The VW framework capabilities will simulate watershed drivers and dynamics and lead to new discoveries.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Immersive virtual reality environments provide platforms that foster interdisciplinary discussion and creative insight into complex scientific questions and enable innovations that result in groundbreaking discoveries. Further, developing three-dimensional thinking skills is an important goal for science education. The Workforce Development and Education program focuses on: (1) implementing an NSF IGERT-like program that prepares graduate students to work in collaborative, interdisciplinary teams to effectively address complex scientific issues, (2) promoting undergraduate faculty professional development and preparing diverse undergraduates for future STEM education and/or employment, and (3) developing education modules that can be incorporated in undergraduate curricula.

The WC-WAVE team recognized that integrating their experimental knowledge and computational skills could provide innovative to help themselves and others who study the complex problems facing watershed science. To ensure that the resulting VWP applied the best data management, visualization techniques and tools, a team of faculty and students with computational expertise and watershed processes and modeling expertise worked collaboratively on common goals. The ultimate goal of the project was to provide the computational and visualization tools necessary to better understand the hydrological impact of changing climate on snow-dominated watersheds in the Western U.S. Instead of starting with a computer-generated simulation of a watershed to develop the VWP, actual watersheds in all three states&mdash;Dry and Reynolds Creeks in Idaho, Lehman Creek in Nevada and the Jemez River watershed in New Mexico&mdash;were used as the basis for VWP development. Information about the characteristics of these four watersheds was ingested into the data management system and converted into formats required for both computer modeling efforts and VWP development. Watershed scientists collaborated with computer science experts to develop software that connects the results of individual model runs and a complementary suite of applications to see the results visually. The long-term goal of the VWP is to expand this product for use beyond the models used in this project to any model and environmental parameter of interest to scientists seeking to visualize their data and modeling results. The resulting VWP allows watershed scientists to not only access and model data, it also provides a means to visualize data and model results across time (e.g., past and future) and space (e.g. different locations within a landscape).  The WC-WAVE project enhanced research capacity for 80 total participants from 13 different academic institutions across the three states. The project gave both undergraduates and graduate students the opportunity to learn about watershed processes, to model the impact of climate on those processes, and to develop computer data management and visualization tools. One of the significant training efforts of this project was the Undergraduate Visualization and Modeling Network (UVMN), which provided an opportunity for faculty and graduate students to mentor 24 faculty and 26 undergraduates from Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) such as Mesalands Community College and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in New Mexico. Key results from this effort included the development of a virtual watershed sandbox as a portable educational tool to demonstrate the effect of topography on surface water flow. It is also used for training in the use of geographic information systems to overlay and analyze various environmental conditions. The UVMN team estimates that the training they received, and in turn disseminated to other PUIs and people from the general public, has now reached at least 5,000 individuals.  Project activities will sustain into the future, and the teams have already deployed another instance of the VWP in Idaho. In addition, they have hired post-doctoral scholars and recruited new graduate students to continue VWP improvements, explore new watershed model efforts, and use the VWP within the classroom to train new computer and watershed science students.  Overall, this project produced 61 journal articles or conference proceedings and 52 professional presentations. Ten undergraduate and 23 graduate students engaged in the project successfully completed degrees.       Last Modified: 10/19/2017       Submitted by: Lucas J Sheneman"
"Natural and managed rivers throughout the world display a wide range of hydrographs, from flashy and abrupt to more gradual changes in flow.  Hydrograph shape (quantified by peak magnitude and rate of discharge change) significantly influences the volume, timing, and quality of water available for anthropogenic use and aquatic ecosystems.  Uncertainties remain as to how unsteady flows that characterize hydrographs impact bedload fluxes and hysteresis, grain size distributions, and the persistence of armor layers. The lack of a mechanistic and predictive understanding of hydrograph influences may also partially explain why bedload transport equations in gravel-bed rivers are often inaccurate. The research team proposes complimentary flume, field, and numerical modeling experiments to quantify the impact of hydrographs on sediment movement.  Specifically, they hypothesize that hydrograph shape influences the following: (1) bed load transport rates, hysteresis, and mobile grain sizes for a given shear stress, and (2) bed grain size distributions and the persistence/degree of bed armoring.  In flume experiments, temporal variability in bedload fluxes, grain size distributions, and armor persistence will be measured for a range of hydrograph shapes.  Field experiments will further investigate the influence of hydrograph shape on bedload transport rates, bed grain size changes, and armor persistence, mobility and removal.  The combined flume and field measurements will be used to test and validate numerical and analytical models for bedload transport. <br/><br/>Hydrographs represent how water quantities in rivers vary over time and can be characterized by the timing, magnitude and rates of change of flow.   Human modifications of these hydrograph characteristics have positively influenced economic development but negatively impacted aquatic species and channel morphology. This is important because 77% of total water discharge from large northern hemisphere rivers is moderately to severely impacted by dams and diversions.  Water resource managers commonly seek to assess and mitigate these impacts through river restoration efforts, hydropower re-regulation, and in some cases dam removal.  For example, gravel augmentation is commonly used to mitigate for low sediment supplies and improve fish habitat below dams but this often has mixed results because of a lack of a predictive understanding of sediment transport caused by variable flows.  Managers could use the results of this research to determine flow hydrograph shapes that potentially mitigate for flow regulation influence on threatened or endangered aquatic organisms.  Further, this research will result in a predictive and mechanistic understanding of the interactions between flow hydrographs, sediment transport, and temporal variations in the size of sediment on the channel bed. Such knowledge is necessary to properly design river infrastructure and restoration projects, and predict long-term channel incision rates and landscape changes.

Changes in sediment transport rates during flow hydrographs (called hysteresis) have previously been attributed to many factors.   We demonstrate through unique laboratory experiments that changes in river bed conditions during hydrographs are a major control on hysteresis and the total sediment volume transported during a given hydrograph.  Management of river systems including flow releases downstream of dams for restoration purposes may need to consider the role of different hydrograph shapes on channel bed conditions, sediment transport, and channel stability.  For the same water volume released (or transport capacity) different hydrograph shapes will promote either river bed stability or mobility.   Graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students and teachers were educated on river processes. We funded scholarships for, and participated in, a Women Outdoors with Science Camp for middle school girls that included learning about flow, sediment transport and aquatic organisms in rivers through rafting trips with scientists.

"Mapping and sampling of a portion of the mid-Atlantic spreading center, where a unique geochemical signature was determined for a 1980's 'popping rock' sample, will take advantage of recent recognition that tectonic deformation may play a role in focusing volatile fluxing from the mantle. Geophysical mapping, targeted sampling by ROV, and a complete suite of post-cruise geochemical analyses aim to determine whether the early quantification of mantle volatiles was representative for the region and/or whether such signatures cluster only near faults, thus implying localized fluxing. Such finding could uproot long-standing inferences about background mantle volatile contents.

Estimates of the carbon concentration in Earth?s upper mantle are uncertain, varying by at least an order of magnitude.  The best estimates available of mantle carbon concentrations come from rocks erupted at mid-ocean ridges (locations where tectonic plates drift apart) and that have retained the volatiles that were present in the mantle. Prior to this study, one of the only examples of an enriched mid-ocean ridge basalt that was inferred to be completely undegassed was collected in 1985 by the Soviet research vessel Akademik Boris Petrov and given the sample name 2pD43. When brought onto the ship sample 2pD43 began popping due to the high gas contents, thus, earning it the name of ?popping rock?. For decades after its discovery, 2pD43 was used as a constraint on mantle volatile contents. However, the geologic context of the rock, and the processes that led to its formation, were not known potentially putting in doubt its usefulness as a proxy for mantle composition. One reason for the lack of geologic context was that the exact location of the original popping rock was uncertain due to poor satellite location technologies at the time of its recovery.    This project aimed to locate the popping rocks, characterize their geologic setting, and determine their likely origin. We aimed to test the relationship between deformation and volatile contents in the recovered basalt rocks. In addition to being the location of the original popping rock, the chosen field area was ideal because existing bathymetry and sonar coverage provided sufficient context for systematic sampling of the ridge axis and other nearby features, such as an Oceanic Core Complexes (OCCs, anomalous, long lived faults found only along slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges) at 13?30? and 13 ?48?N.   Marine field activities included two expeditions to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in 2016 and 2018, and a land-based field excursion to the Josephine Peridotite to examine the behavior of helium in peridotite shear zones. Field work in the Josephine was not originally envisioned in the project but was an ideal way to directly examine a proposed relationship between deformation and gas concentrations discussed in the original proposal.  The marine expeditions successfully found the location of the popping rocks, and later analysis found very high He and C contents of the sampled popping rocks and potential evidence for a relationship between magmatism and the end of the life cycle of oceanic core complexes. Tomographic imaging of the rock samples has shown that gases tend to be stored in gas bubbles in the outer portions of samples.  The results of this project have significant implications for understanding the origin of popping rocks, the nature of mantle carbon and volatile contents, and the interaction of magmatism and oceanic core complex evolution. For example, analysis of initial samples recovered in 2016 provides evidence for upper mantle heterogeneity at small scales. Furthermore, we were able to contribute to the understanding of plate boundary deformation at OCCs through examination of near-bottom magnetic and lithological observations acquired by the Sentry AUV and Alvin dives during the 2016 expedition. We found that the 13?48'N OCC is cross-cut by an ~850m-wide volcanic terrain, which also coincides with an axis-parallel normal fault, but that this volcanic eruption likely did not stop the extension along this OCC, in contrast to existing models of OCC evolution. These results suggest that magmatism may occur regularly on active OCCs without stopping accommodation of tectonic slip.  Results of this project have been disseminated in several ways including three published manuscripts in international journals, 11 conference presentations at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union (2015-2018), a M.S. thesis, and two accepted abstracts for the Fall 2019 Meeting of the AGU. In addition, a further manuscript is in preparation by the REU student Daniel King at University of Idaho with a planned submission in February, 2020.  An REU supplement to this award provided two undergraduate students from University of Idaho and two from Boise State University an opportunity to participate in the 2018 marine expedition. The program began with a semester long course on marine geology field techniques, which culminated in development of student projects designed to leverage data to be collected during the cruise. The four students then participated in the 2018 field expedition followed by a 6-week summer research program where they pursued projects of their own design.  Three of the students subsequently presented results of their efforts at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December, 2018.

"Topography in mountainous regions is a product of the erosion and export of material across the landscape.  The frequency and magnitude of erosion events occurring in these regions is controlled by the local climate.  The topography of the mountain ranges, in turn, influences the climate.  This suggests a coupling between atmospheric and geomorphic processes in regions of active mountain building.  Observational studies of climate-topography-erosion relationships, however, have been equivocal.  One potential reason for this disparity in observational results is that the modern climate, for which most studies depend on, is a poor representation of the integrated climate history over landscape.  Over the timescale of mountain building, climate can vary due to orbital variations, greenhouse gas concentrations, and the development of topography.  This work will develop a coupled climate-landscape evolution model framework to quantitatively investigate interactions between climate, topography, and erosion on geologic timescales. The co-evolution of climate and landscapes will be modeled at different latitudes (e.g. tropical, sub-tropical, and mid-latitude) and for different orbital configurations in order to increase our understanding of the spatial and temporal variability inherent in the coupled climate and landscape systems.  This work will complement previous and ongoing empirical studies exploring the interaction of climate and topography. <br/><br/>Quantifying the interaction between the climate and topography is relevant to a number of societal issues including the rate of sediment input to reservoirs, the terrestrial carbon cycle, and the intensity of erosion processes in agricultural and uplands systems.  The role of climate in controlling erosion rates also has broader geological implications due its potential influence on tectonic processes in regions of active mountain building. Moreover, fully understanding the Earth as a system, including surface and lithospheric components, requires a quantitative framework for linking climate, erosion, and tectonics.  This research will contribute towards this goal.

Questions surrounding climate?s role in landscape evolution have remained difficult to answer because of the complicated interactions between precipitation, topography, vegetation, sediment, lithology and more. Through this research we sought to use numerical models to simplify these complicating factors and concentrate only on the interactions between precipitation and topographic growth and decay. The primary achievement of this work was the coupling of three numerical models: a climate model, a hydrological model, and a landscape evolution model. After successfully coupling these models we used the climate model and hydrological model to produce precipitation data and discharge data respectively. The Andes were used as the climatic setting for these experiments due to the large variation in climate across the length of the mountain range.  This research represents an exciting next step in landscape evolution modeling through the use of a high-resolution climate model to predict erosion and landscape response. Precipitation has often been represented through statistics and annual averages in landscape evolution models. By coupling a climate model to a landscape evolution model, we now allow the climate in a region to react to an evolving landscape. As elevations and topographic form change through time, so too does the amount and location of the modeled precipitation. With this coupling we can now run experiments to explore the importance of climate in landscape evolution. In addition to improving the ways in which we approach modeling climate and tectonic interactions, this work also aims to aid in our ability to predict and adjust to the effects of climate change. Understanding climate variability has become more important than ever before. Climate change will lead to changes in the distribution of precipitation around the world. As the locations and intensities of storms begin to change, the production, transport and deposition of sediment will change as well. Erosion and deposition of sediment is critical for societal resources including farming, fisheries, reservoirs, and more. Working to understand climate?s impact on erosion and sediment production and transport will allow us to mitigate the effects of a changing climate on these valuable resources.

"It is widely accepted among evolutionary biologists that speciation is a gradual and constant process. As an empirical investigation of the unified species concept, this study seeks to understand how the evidence for speciation has accumulated over time, and to quantify the tempo and mode of trait evolution, in the North American group of the plant genus Castilleja (the paintbrushes) inferring if there is an order or a sequence for the acquisition of species properties, and if specific properties are more important than others at a certain times or depths in their evolutionary history. Additionally, paintbrushes are one of the most emblematic groups of wildflowers in western North America, but are also one of the most taxonomically difficult; this study will provide the evolutionary framework necessary to investigate species delimitation, and create a stable and useful infrageneric classification to aid in species identification, future discovery, and conservation. Furthermore, the proposed work will critically evaluate the evolutionary and ecological correlates of diversification, allowing for the discovery of the extent to which extrinsic (e.g. geography and/or ecology) and intrinsic (e.g. polyploidy and/or morphology) isolating mechanisms lead to increased diversification rates, and increase our understanding of the process of speciation in the heterogeneous mountains of western North America.<br/><br/>This project also integrates education and training across multiple subdisciplines in the biodiversity sciences (e.g. from molecular systematics to floristic research) and across multiple educational levels (from K-12 to postdoc). It is clear that federal land management and science agencies are facing a significant shortage of botanical expertise that will reduce our ability to conserve natural landscapes in the future. The richness found in the texture that the biodiversity sciences add to the natural world is where the Advanced Field Botany course proposed here will fill this growing need for botanical expertise, provide significant career opportunities to students, and enhance botanical education and research at the University of Idaho.

This study sought to provide the evolutionary framework necessary to investigate species boundaries, and create a stable and useful infrageneric classification to aid in species identification, future discovery, and conservation. To accomplish these goals, it was necessary to document the diversity of species throughout their range in North America, generate molecular datasets that allowed for the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships in the group, and analyze these data to investigate the evolutionary and ecological correlates of diversification, increasing our understanding of the process of speciation in the heterogeneous mountains of western North America.  This project developed novel high-throughput amplicon generation and sequencing approaches, novel bioinformatic approaches, and novel genomic resources that have all been important for this specific project, but also for the molecular systematic research community as a whole.  Fourteen peer reviewed articles representing the work of several graduate students, undergraduates, a postdoctoral researcher, and multiple collaborators resulted from this project. These papers were published in a variety of journals, including New Phytologist, Applications in Plant Sciences, American Journal of Botany, Systematic Botany, Madro&ntilde;o, Molecular Ecology, Peer J, and PLOS One, demonstrating the broad interest and importance of our work.  We collected and curated 700+ collections of the more than 100 Castilleja species that occur in North America throughout this project; all collections have been added to the University of Idaho Stillinger Herbarium, and are available through our Consortium of Pacific Northwest Herbaria data portal (www.pnwheraria.org), increasing the value of these collections for both the research community and the public. Comparisons of phylogenetic analyses of our large multilocus datasets has revealed a pattern of repeated rounds of isolation and secondary contact, where species-level diversity seems to have been generated and maintained in the presence of widespread gene flow. As a significant part of this project, we developed the necessary wet-lab and bioinformatic pipelines for producing and processing these complex multilocus datasets, and the hypotheses and analytical approaches that are necessary to formally test these hypotheses. These results will be very important for formulating broader hypotheses regarding the generation and maintenance of plant diversity in western North America (and elsewhere) where the geological and climatic histories have been so important for the last 15 million years.   This project also supported the development and teaching of an Advanced Field Botany course for seven years (2013-2019). This two-week course was taught out of the University of Idaho McCall field station, where we partnered with the Payette National Forest to conduct floristic surveys in undercollected areas. The course trained 47 students in botanical collecting, preservation, identification, and curation, and included undergraduates, graduate students, land management professionals, and high school teachers from multiple different institutions and agencies from around the country.  In total, over the seven years of the course, we made over 2,800 collections, and identified and databased 2,495 of these collections, which are publically accessible through the Consortium of Pacific Northwest Herbaria data portal (pnwherbaria.org).

"Estimating the heat flux from the Yellowstone volcanic system has been pursued in different ways over the past 50 years.  Understanding the geothermal flux from Yellowstone is important for many reasons: heat and mass flux are an important part of determining the volcano's eruptive potential, and it has been suggested that changes in heat flux or hot brine migration may be correlated with inflation/deflation of the caldera floor or large seismic events.  More fundamentally, the heat flux at the land surface is controlled by the quantity of heat entering the bottom of the system.  The overall active heat budget of the Yellowstone caldera has been estimated in the past using chloride mass balance in spring discharges.  This method is subject to assumptions and uncertainties.  This project will explore the feasibility of a new method to infer mass and energy fluxes for Yellowstone hot springs.  The team will use cross-correlation of spring and atmospheric temperatures that allow estimates for spring discharge (mass flux) and the inflow spring temperature (and hence enthalpy flux).   Estimates of the advective mass and energy flux (using a time-series method) combined with the diffusive energy flux between springs will allow them to derive a comprehensive description of mass and energy fluxes between the shallow subsurface and the atmosphere.<br/><br/>The data to be obtained in this project will be used to improve estimates of heat and mass flux for the shallow hydrothermal system in the Yellowstone caldera.  The methods that to be developed will define a template for future heat and mass balance studies of hydrothermal systems.  It is expected that the methods to be employed in this study and the data to be gathered in the course of this project will be important to volcanic hazard assessment, as well as contributing to public education and enjoyment of Yellowstone and other national resources.  It is also possible that the time-series method of evaluating heat and mass flux of hydrothermal springs as developed here could be approached via satellite-based telemetry.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research and their training in this project will provide them with career-building opportunities.

Almost all studies of heat loss from the land surface at Yellowstone have concentrated on chloride balance in surface waters draining the park as a means of estimating heat flux; however, these estimation methods are restricted to advective heat flux (heat associated with flowing water), and generally neglect the contribution of conductive heat transfer (heat diffusing through the earth in the areas immediately adjacent to hot springs or flowing fluids).  We investigated the partitioning of heat between advective and conductive modes in the vicinity of three hot spring groups in the Yellowstone Caldera: the Morning Mist Springs, River Group Springs, and Pocket Basin.  Our results show that a significant fraction of the total heat budget of a group of springs may be transferred by conduction; in some cases, the conductive heat losses may account for as much as 50% of the total heat flux (although in many cases advective heat transfer probably dominates).  We also compared the distribution of ground temperatures in the vicinity of hot spring groups, and were able to show that different settings of spring groups give rise to diagnostic temperature distributions in the near-surface.  In particular, we can distinguish between diffusive heat flux from a shallow, liquid-water dominated system (exemplified by the Morning Mist Springs area), heat loss through an altered clay cap by steam-heating (River Group Springs I), and heat loss in a fracture controlled, liquid-dominated discharge area (River Group Springs II).  On the basis of our observations, data collected at these three areas, and supplemental data and observations from hydrothermal discharge areas in southeast Oregon (Borax Lake and Mickey Hot Springs, Alvord Basin OR) and central Idaho (Burgdorf Hot Springs), we developed a quantitative theory for interpreting ground surface thermal anomalies arising from shallow, laterally-flowing hydrothermal fluids.  In the final year of this study, we sought to expand our work to a new, unstudied area of the Yellowstone Caldera on the northeast flank of Sour Creek Dome.  This new area is located in close proximity to what is believed to be the shallowest magma in the caldera, and is likely positioned above or near to ring-faulting associated with caldera collapse following the Lava Creek eruption (~640,000 years ago), which places it in a critical position for understanding the current dynamics of the Yellowstone volcanic system.  Future studies will aim at expanding our heat flux studies to this new site, and other under-studied thermal areas in the Yellowstone Caldera.    Beyond the intellectual merit of the study, described above, the project offered broader impacts to society in terms of research experiences for eight undergraduate students, four of whom were recruited from non-PhD granting institutions of higher education, graduate education opportunities (including thesis/dissertation topics) for five graduate students, and avenues for professional development and collaboration for both student and faculty researchers.

"Americans depend on the existing Emergency Communications Systems (ECS) to save lives, either via 911 calls to ambulance, police and fire services or via the broadcast Emergency Alert System.   The existing Emergency Communications Systems (ECS) infrastructure is becoming increasingly outdated due to the migration of voice and video services to Internet-based technologies.    The Network Slicing for Emergency Communications (NSEC) is a prototype US Ignite demonstration project that will utilize GENI slices to create a demonstration system of a robust, reliable, and scalable alternative to existing ECS.   This demonstration will use network slicing to provide priority and dedicated bandwidth and cloud services to simplify operations, create sustainability and maintain extensibility.   The GENI slicing framework will also provide isolation from Denial of Service attacks.  The City of Ammon (Bonneville County), Idaho, Albion Telephone Company (ATC), an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) with territories located in Southern Idaho and Northern Utah, and Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency (UTOPIA) with serving territories throughout Utah will support this effort.

Many of the multi-disciplinary research problems we are currently investigating at University of Idaho (UI) require the use of large-scale resources that cannot be provided by traditional machines or computer clusters that are currently available at the UI. The impact this acquisition is wide spread across many disciplines and colleges due to the intrinsic flexibility of this machine and the lack of existing resources. For example researchers in Physics, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Material Science Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science all currently have research problems which cannot be readily solved by existing resources on campus. In most of these cases the available commercial resources are prohibitively expensive, which often creates a fundamental limitation in the types and scale of research problems that can be solved. The BIG-STEM resource has allowed these researchers to begin to conduct research into problems that have been unapproachable. Some specific examples of on-going research that this machine enables includes: molecular dynamics simulations in the Physics department, simulation of wave loads on off-shore wind turbines in the Mechanical Engineering department, Eco hydraulic research in Civil Engineering as well as on-going collaborations between Electrical and Computer Engineering and Mechanical Engineering to understand thermal mechanical stresses in microelectronic devices, and design of fast algorithms for multiscale problems, which enables collaboration between University of Idaho departments of Math and Mechanical Engineering with the Idaho National Laboratory, and Washington State University.

"This project will establish a Research Coordination Network (RCN) to develop national and international research collaborations and partnerships to address the overarching question of how to reduce the vulnerability of natural and human systems in complex mountain landscapes. The Northern Rockies region of the United States contains the largest undeveloped landscapes in the contiguous United States.  However, this region is undergoing rapid growth in human populations through both urbanization and ex-urbanization. As is typical of mountain-valley environments throughout the world, this region is a complex coupled natural-human system: a set of landscapes characterized by dramatic ecological and climatic changes and socioeconomic transitions. This effort leverages a core group from the University of Idaho, Washington State University, University of Montana and the United States Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station to coordinate research planning for informing decision processes and sustainable management of forest and water resources in complex mountain landscapes. The research network for this region will be a partnership of academic institutions, state, and federal agencies, Native American tribes, and non-governmental organizations. An important goal of this RCN is to effectively network multiple sources of knowledge on how ecosystems function in complex mountain landscapes for the purpose of improving social and ecological resilience and sustainability of their natural resources and ecosystem services. The work will first demonstrate this process in the Northern Rockies region encompassing Idaho, eastern Washington, western Montana, Wyoming, and southwestern mountain regions of Canada. Subsequent work will extend the model to other complex mountain landscapes nationally and internationally. Extension of the regional model internationally will be facilitated through collaborations and partnerships developed with researchers and organizations in eleven countries throughout Europe, North and South America and through the International Long Term Ecological Research Network. <br/><br/>This project will have substantial broader impacts on local stakeholders and land managers through activities that build and expand partnerships with public, Native American, and private institutions of education and through outreach to inform decision making and governance that improves social and ecological resilience. Education programs will range from creating national and international graduate student associations to curriculum development, with a primary objective being to increase involvement of individuals from underrepresented groups.

MtnSEON represents new collaborations among scientists, managers, and stakeholders in the Western United States, including: universities and tribal colleges in Idaho, Washington, Montana, Oregon, Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado; federal agencies including the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Geological Survey; and ranchers, farmers, and community members from Idaho, Oregon, and Washington..   The program coordinated research examining diverse challenges in managing mountain landscapes, including conflicts and cooperation between ranchers and forest managers over predator populations, between different agencies over the regulation of river flows and conservation of native salmonids, between ranchers and Native American tribal stakeholders over multi-use landscapes, and between ecologists and economists over the bark-beetle?s impacts on Western forests. These issues are neither solely ecological nor social in nature, and so their successful management requires innovative approaches combining ecological and social thinking and that include understanding the dynamics and interactions among the many aspects of mountain landscapes. An important aspect of this program has been the importance of listening to and incorporating multiple and diverse perspectives and the need to be adaptive to constantly changing circumstances.   The most significant outcome from MtnSEON has been the publication of a special issue in a journal of the Ecological Society of America, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment. Titled ""Social-Ecological Systems in Mountain Landscapes,"" the special issue highlights the use of social-ecological systems (SES) science, a field that uses anthropology, ecology, economics, hydrology, and geography to explain the balance between communities, their economies, and the ecosystems around them.   Topics covered in the issue include the human aspects of predator-livestock interactions in the American West, social-ecological perspectives for riverscape management in the Columbia River Basin, and the use of social-ecological observatories to carry out SES studies. While traditional ecology is focused on everything in the environment except for people, the Frontiers special issue, and MtnSEON generally, focuses on the need to look at relationships between people, the environment, ecosystems, and the dynamic interplay between them. This goes some way toward addressing the challenges faced by mountain communities regarding complex environmental issues.   The efforts in social-ecological science championed by MtnSEON paves the way for new directions in research, management, and policy, providing examples of potential methodologies and settings in which SES science can be successfully used and implemented.

"1235885 (Coats).  This research will systematically integrate proteomic methods with environmental engineering principles to advance a ?waste-to-products? process to upcycle organic waste to a biodegradable plastic, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs).  Not only will the process sequester carbon that would otherwise be emitted as a greenhouse gas, the high-value product (PHA) will displace petroleum usage.  The PHA technology represents opportunities for industries to generate products of economic value while reducing waste management costs. The overarching fundamental research question this proposed study seeks to answer is as follows: ?What are the controlling metabolisms/proteins associated with feast/famine PHA synthesis by mixed microbial consortia and how can they be functionally manipulated using standard bioreactor operating criteria to maximize conversion of VFAs to PHA?? The following research questions will guide the project. RQ 1: What are the potential effects of dairy cow nutrition on volatile fatty acid synthesis? RQ 2: What are the metabolism-specific proteins associated with aerobic feast/famine PHA synthesis? What are the underlying genetic regulators? RQ 3: Are the metabolism-specific proteins and regulators identical, or similar, across different microbial species performing feast/famine PHA synthesis? RQ 4: How do we apply and manipulate traditional bioreactor operating criteria to maximize enrichment of feast/famine PHA microbes and induce necessary metabolisms to yield maximum VFA sequestration as PHA? An overview of the research approach is as follows. Obj. 1 activities will evaluate and establish the effects of manure characteristics on VFA synthesis. Obj. 2 and 3 activities are the core focus of this research that will respond to RQs 2-4. The research will integrate to exact macro/micro structure-function relationships on mixed microbial consortia performing feast/famine PHA synthesis. Results from Obj. 2 and 3 will identify and explain at a molecular structure/function level the bioreactor operating criteria necessary to maximize PHA synthesis in a manner and at a level that traditional ?black box? methods could not define. An important culmination of this research will be the pilot-scale process validation investigations under Obj. 4.  This research will advance both fundamental and practical knowledge to bio-convert dairy manure to high economic value bioplastic (PHA).

The ""disposal-first"" concept has historically applied to most waste streams generated in developed societies, and has a legacy embedded in environmental regulations. However, in recent years the true potential value of waste streams has begun to be realized and appreciated. Research and investigations focused on advancing fundamental knowledge related to converting an otherwise undesired waste (dairy manure) to a valuable commodity (PHBV, which is a biodegradable, sustainable plastic). The U.S. dairy industry is in dire need of environmentally sustainable solutions to dairy manure management that also generate needed revenue; it is this approach that will greatly enhance and stabilize U.S. agricultural industries that generate solid and liquid waste streams, in broad support of a sustainable food-energy-water system. The studied process involves feeding bacteria fermented dairy manure that contains large quantities of organic acids (acetic acid, propionic acid, etc.). The bacteria store the excess organic carbon internally; this storage product can be recovered, and is a plastic. The plastic can be utilized to replace nearly all oil-derived plastics in a variety of applications.     We first examined the bacterial process at a molecular level. Specifically, we described and characterized the microbial ecology both on population (i.e., which bacteria dominated) and function (i.e., what are they doing). We applied advanced next generation sequencing and proteomic methods to describe the process. Results showed a diverse bacterial population capable of PHBV production; the diversity enhances overall process stability. Protein-level studies highlighted key aspects of the process bacteria use in converting and storing the organic acids to PHBV. Building upon the molecular studies, we examined the process more at a macro level, refining engineered parameters to design and operate the waste resource recovery process. As a final stage in the research, we examined the causes of intrinsic hesitation toward waste resource recovery technology adoption, with an emphasis at the local level where the concept must nucleate. Specifically, we investigated, characterized, and described non-technical socio-political barriers to realizing broad-scale resource recovery from wastewater. Principal actors in the Pacific NW region of the U.S. (a region representing a progressive populace that is concurrently facing stringent regulatory water quality challenges) were interviewed. Economic considerations within a context of broader business case evaluations that also considered social-institutional dynamics were a primary barrier to expansion of wastewater resource recovery. Also pervasive was the view there is mostly downside to deploying new technologies, with little perceived upside, and thus significant risk. Nevertheless, the consensus was that enhanced resource recovery is a necessary future for waste management, and that the real barriers are surmountable. In summary, research has positioned the PI and his team to seek commercial application of the PHBV technology in the next 2-4 years; additionally, the PI has built a broader foundation in the area of waste resource recovery that will translate into future solutions in achieving sustainable food-energy-water systems.     The research supported four graduate students, one earning a PhD in biochemistry and three earning Master?s degrees in environmental engineering. Funds also supported numerous undergraduate researchers, who gained significant exposure to science and engineering research in the context of waste resource recovery and sustainability. Four journal publications were delivered, along with numerous conference presentations; collectively, the research was shared with a broad and diverse audience. The PI also conducted outreach and training to K-12 teachers at two workshops during the summer of 2015. Beyond the human resources successes, the research demonstrated to other researchers (scientists and engineers) that sophisticated molecular methods can be employed to explain and describe biotechnological processes in complex environments &ndash; in this case, complex bacterial cultures and even more complex waste streams.

"Thermoacoustic tomography is a hybrid method of biomedical imaging. It combines heating the tissues by microwave energy with detecting the induced ultrasound signals to achieve simultaneously high contrast and high resolution. Photoacoustic tomography is a sibling method, which uses laser light instead of microwaves to heat up the tissues. The two modalities have the same mathematical model, the observability problem of wave equation. The project is aimed to study several important mathematical issues relevant to these modalities. Firstly, it deals with the case of constant acoustic speed, addressing the range description, inversion formulas, and injectivity of the restricted spherical mean transform. Secondly, it studies the case of variable ultrasound speed. Topics include limited data, generalized spherical transform, and layered acoustic medium. Lastly, it considers the problem of finding the unknown ultrasound speed. <br/><br/>The results from this project will contribute to the developments of new promising techniques in biomedical imaging. These developments will greatly impact the life science research, as they will help to provide better diagnostic information of non-transparent biological objects, e.g. patients' bodies.

Thermoacoustic tomography (TAT) is a hybrid method of imaging. It combines the high contrast of electromagnetic imaging and high resolution of ultrasound imaging. A short electromagnetic pulse at microwave frequency is scanned to slightly heat up the biological object of interest. The thermoelastic effect produces an ultrasound pressure propagating throughout the space, which is measured outside of the object. The goal of TAT is to find the internal structure of the object from the measured signal. Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a sibling of TAT, where the laser light is used instead of microwaves.  In this project, we have successfully worked on the following mathematical issues of TAT/PAT: characterizing the data, deriving and analyzing the image reconstruction algorithms, characterizing and eliminating image's artifacts, incorporating the effect of object's motion into the image reconstruction.  The project also finds applications in other kind of tomography, such as X-ray CT (X-ray computed tomography), SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging), PET (Positron Emission Tomography), and SPECT (Single-photon emission computed tomography).  As the outcomes of this project, we have:  1) Completed 11 papers and started several other papers, gave 17 talks, advised 3 undergraduate students, taught a course in ""Mathematics of Tomography"", organized two research gatherings, established several new research connections  2) Deepened the knowledge of several areas of mathematics: inverse problems, integral geometry, wave propagation, and microlocal analysis  3) Generated, analyzed, and implemented new efficient algorithms for thermoacoustic/photoacoustic tomography  4) Fostered the applied mathematics research in the department of Mathematics at the University of Idaho.

"Collaborative Research: Novel interdisciplinary flume experiments to investigate the role of the hyporheic zone in greenhouse gas generation<br/>Daniele Tonina, University of Idaho <br/>Kevin Feris and Shawn Benner, Boise State University<br/><br/>The hyporheic zone is the band of saturated sediment surrounding the stream, where stream waters mix with pore-water. This zone plays an important role in the nitrogen cycle, which has been radically altered by anthropogenic food and energy production. Furthermore, this zone may be a significant source of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O), potentially emitting for up to 0.7 Tg y-1, equivalent to 10% of global anthropogenic N2O emissions. While the degree of hyporheic exchange is strongly influenced by stream flow and streambed topography, the relationship between those physical processes and the resulting microbially-mediated geochemical reactions leading to N2O generation and release remains poorly understood. The goal of this interdisciplinary research is to understand, quantify, and parameterize the influence of streambed hydraulics and morphology on the emission of N2O from the hyporheic zone. The generation of N2O via denitrification primarily occurs within the streambed sediments where the catalyzing microbial community is present.  Therefore, the mass transport of oxygen, nitrates, ammonium and N2O by hyporheic flow strongly influences reaction rates, residence times, and subsequent N2O production. By extension, stream flow and channel morphology presumably control, and may be effective predictors of, N2O generation rates. However, a number of important in-situ processes remain poorly understood. For example, the amount of reactive nitrogen converted to N2O versus N2 is quite small (0-6%) but highly uncertain, due in part to an incomplete understanding of the genetic composition of the dominant microbial community and the hydrologic factors affecting their distribution and activity. Additionally, controls on the contribution of in-situ reactive nitrogen generation vs. that delivered by the stream are not easily determined in natural systems. Indeed, the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of natural systems limits the strength of traditional observational approaches and precludes explicit expression of these interactions in predictive mathematical models. To overcome limitations of traditional observational field approaches, this research will use a series of manipulative large-scale flume experiments. Large-scale flume experiments will provide unprecedented control while maintaining intrinsically important variables such as a realistic microbial community, water composition, stream flow, and channel structure. <br/><br/>This research will develop new understanding of the fundamental interaction among surface-subsurface water exchange, nitrogen transformation and N2O emissions from the hyporheic zone and ultimately from streams. It will explain the role of the hyporheic zone as a biochemical transformation zone by coupling hyporheic hydraulics to biochemical reactions, through numerical-analytical models and flume experiments. Results from this work will act as building blocks for modeling N2O emissions from streams at the watershed scale. Thus, this first stage of controlled manipulative experimentation is essential in advancing our knowledge of water resources at the large scale.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,247624.00,247624,4900,Hydrologic Sciences,1141690,,Daniele Tonina,322 E Front Street,Boise,US,ID02,University of Idaho,ID,837027309,dtonina@uidaho.edu,Daniele,Tonina,,Thomas Torgersen,,['01001213DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],03/05/2012,06/01/2012,05/31/2016,Collaborative Research: Novel interdisciplinary flume experiments to investigate the role of the hyporheic zone in greenhouse gas generation,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,," Stream waters flow at the surface, above streambeds, and subsurface, within the streambed sediments. The residence time and amount of stream water flowing within the streambed depend on multiple mechanisms, of which the main ones are the interaction between surface water and streambed sediment, sediment hydraulic conductivity and ground water table. The subsurface stream water forms the so-called hyporheic zone (HZ), where stream water is temporally stored and stream water borne reactive solutes undergo biogeochemical reactions. Among those reactions, ones of the most important are those of the nitrogen cycle, which has been radically altered by anthropogenic food and energy production.     Streams, in which nitrogen was typically limited prior to the green revolution, have seen an increase in reactive nitrogen loads, which are a significant source of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Streams potentially emit up to 0.7 Tg y-1, equivalent to 10% of global anthropogenic N2O emissions. Stream N2O production mainly occurs via denitrification within the streambed sediments. This is a heterotrophic microbially-mediated reaction that transforms nitrate to the nitrogenous gasses di-nitrogen gas (N2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), and that connects the Carbon and Nitrogen cycles in the HZ. Hyporheic flows, which generate the exchange of stream water between streams and streambed sediment, are the main mass transport of oxygen, nitrates, ammonium and N2O in and out of the streambed sediment. They strongly influence reaction rates, residence times, and subsequent N2O production. Because the main mechanism inducing hyporheic flows is the interaction between stream flow and streambed morphology, the main hypothesis of this project was that stream flow and channel morphology may be effective predictors of N2O generation rates. The goal of this research was to understand, quantify, and parameterize the influence of streambed hydraulics and morphology on the emission of N2O from the HZ and consequently from streams.     To address this goal, this research used a series of manipulative large-scale flume experiments (Figure 1) coupled with a set of meso-scale column experiments (Figure 2). Sand from the Boise river with its natural microbial communities was used as sediment and leaves from cottonwood trees on the banks of the Boise river as carbon source. The large-scale flume experiments provided unprecedented control while maintaining intrinsically important variables such as a realistic microbial community (from the Boise river), water composition (carbon filtered city water), stream flow (constant discharge), thermal regime (relatively constant temperature) and channel structure (dune-like bedforms). Streambed oxic and anoxic sediments were mapped at a spatial (107 point/m2) and temporal (sub-daily) resolution never reached before. This allowed detailed characterization of the evolution of redox conditions within the sediments. To achieve these resolutions a unique and novel multipoint (125 points) non-invasive dissolved oxygen sensor was developed during this project in collaboration with PreSense (a German sensor developing company) and Agiltron (a USA optical multiplexor company). DO sampling points were coupled with sampling ports, from which pore water was drawn out of the sediment for chemical analysis. Additionally electrical conductivity sensors were added at selected ports at the end of the experiment, when a conservative tracer (sodium chloride) was injected to quantify HZ residence time empirically. These empirical measurements enhanced by numerical modeling of the hyporheic flow addressed the project hypothesis.     Both set of experiments, flume and column mesocosms, unveil that N2O is produced within the HZ (Figure 3). Conversely to present-day expectation, production does not increase monotonically with residence time or length of the flow line but reaches a peak and then decreases. This is a fundamental result stating that only a certain portion of the streambed sediment is source of N2O and the rest is of the benign N2. The specific range of residence times that are net producers of N2O depends on the interaction among microbial activity, microbial population distributions, the reactivity of carbon present in the system and the interaction between stream hydraulics and bedform. These results support previous observations that elevated nitrate and declining organic carbon reactivity increase N2O production, highlighting the importance of associated reaction rates in controlling N2O accumulation. However, further research is necessary to link N2O peak values with organic carbon quality and availability. Our results also provide an initial indication of a threshold level of denitrifier population densities above which N2O production is observed; and that the relative abundance of the gene associated with N2O reduction to N2 influences the net production or consumption of N2O by a HZ microbial community. Data analysis suggests that a dimensionless number, which is the ratio between an index of residence time (which depends on stream hydraulics and bedform interaction) of stream water within the sediment and the time required for dissolved oxygen to reach a threshold concentration below which the system switched from aerobic to anaerobic, could predict which flow lines are sources of N2O and those which are not.

"Because natural landscapes are changing rapidly, understanding the factors that determine how organisms select both habitats and resources remains a central question in ecology.  Theory predicts that animals can balance the costs posed by food quantity or quality, predation risk, and the physical environment, but few studies have adequately assessed how multiple variables interact at spatial and temporal scales that are functionally relevant to a foraging animal.  This research offers a new and synthetic approach to understand functional links between habitat features and habitat use. It combines behavioral, nutritional, chemical, spatial, and physiological ecology to evaluate comprehensively the factors that influence habitat use by generalist and specialist herbivores: two species of rabbits. Tradeoffs among four habitat features (nutrients in food, toxins in food, security cover, and thermal cover) will be measured in the laboratory and under natural field conditions to model and compare the functional importance of these features.  The investigators will integrate results to predict resource selection and infer habitat quality when organisms are faced with complex decisions in natural environments. <br/><br/>This research develops a new method for quantifying habitat value in a relatively simple system that will enhance predictions of the consequences of environmental change in more complex systems.  It includes a novel educational model that trains graduate, undergraduate, and high school students who will conduct research collaboratively across three universities, participate in a tiered mentoring program, and engage with the community and regional biologists.

This seems like a simple task, but doing so requires that we understand not just what an animal chooses, but also why.  Our goal was to develop a new way to model habitat selection by animals that addresses the ""why"" question and also allows us to measure the value of different resources to those animals.  We tackled this issue by studying the pygmy rabbit, the world?s smallest rabbit that lives only in the sagebrush rangelands of the western USA.  Pygmy rabbits are a species of conservation concern that use sagebrush shrubs for food, security from predators, and shelter from extreme temperatures.  Sagebrush smells great because it contains several different chemicals that are meant to discourage browsing by animals, but pygmy rabbits have an interesting ability to tolerate these chemicals.  Most other animals like cottontail rabbits cannot eat as much of the plant chemicals.   We conducted two types of research: 1) studies of habitat selection by captive pygmy and cottontail rabbits where we controlled the options available and limited confounding factors, and 2) field studies where we observed the behavior of free-ranging, wild rabbits.  In the captive experiments, we offered rabbits different combinations of food, security and temperature, and we measured their choices.  We developed a mathematical model that allowed us to quantify how much of one they would tradeoff for another (for example, how much food quality they would give up to forage in a safe versus risky location).  Then, we compared tradeoffs between forage, security and temperature made by pygmy rabbits (diet and habitat specialists) with tradeoffs made by cottontail rabbits that are about twice the size of pygmy rabbits and are considered habitat generalists.  Next, we went to the field and measured each of these properties (food, security, and thermal shelter) at many locations within our study sites in Idaho, and we used imagery collected from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to map these properties across the landscapes.  We used GPS telemetry to track free-ranging pygmy rabbits and record their locations and habitat use during both summer and winter.   We found that pygmy rabbits valued security more than food quality when compared to cottontails.  This makes sense because they are smaller and potentially more vulnerable to a broader range of predators, and they can tolerate at least some plant chemicals better than cottontails.  Also, temperature influenced the foraging behavior of both rabbit species &ndash; both ate more food and consumed forage with lower nutrition at colder temperatures, but temperature did not influence the amount of plant chemicals that animals consumed in the diet.   In the field, we documented that pygmy rabbits traded off security and thermal shelter differently between seasons.  During summer, rabbits selected shaded habitats with high concealment from predators, but activity levels were independent of ambient temperature.  During winter, however, security, but not thermal properties, influenced selection of habitat, and activity was positively correlated with ambient temperature, especially during nighttime and early morning hours.  The ability of animals to shift behavior with temperature might help to buffer them from the consequences of climate change, up to a point.  Understanding what habitat resources animals value and how they tradeoff competing resource needs can help us to better manage multiple use landscapes to maintain quality habitat for wildlife.  This is especially important when climate and landscapes are changing rapidly.          Last Modified: 08/30/2017       Submitted by: Janet L Rachlow"
"As much as 50% of the typical mammalian genome consists of retrotransposed sequences, dominated by LINE-1 and various types of SINE retrotransposons. LINE-1 encodes genes for its own retrotransposition, but is also parasitized by SINEs for their movement.  LINE-1 has been co-evolving with its mammalian hosts for at least 170 million years and has had major impacts on their evolution.  However, two LINE-1 extinction events have been documented, affecting 9% of mammalian species. Shutting down LINE-1 activity should result in a simultaneous silencing of SINEs.  However, in a LINE-1 extinction event in South American rodents, the extinction of the B1 family of SINEs was unexpectedly found to precede the extinction of LINE-1. Reconstruction of the common ancestor of the extinct LINE-1 and B1 and analysis of their interactions in a tissue culture assay will be used to explore the mechanism underlying their extinction.<br/><br/>Although retrotransposons like LINEs and SINEs have had large impacts on mammalian evolution, our knowledge of them is limited to the study of sequenced genomes and work in model organisms. The arms race between LINE-1 and B1, or autonomous and the corresponding non-autonomous transposons in a broader sense, has been investigated by computational simulations, but empirical data are scarce. Tools developed to understand the mechanism of transpositions in humans and model organisms will be extended to a non-model system with a unique evolutionary history. This proposal will contribute to the larger picture of mammalian genome evolution and transposable element regulation.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,14508.00,14508,4900,EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS,1210694,,Holly A Wichman,,Moscow,US,ID00,University of Idaho,ID,838443020,hwichman@uidaho.edu,Holly,Wichman,,George Gilchrist,,['01001213DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],05/09/2012,06/01/2012,05/31/2014,Dissertation Research:  Probing Retrotransposon Extinctions,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Lei Yang'],A,," Transposable elements, also known as jumping genes, account for approximately half of a typical mammalian genome.  They increase in copy number because the majority of them mobilize within the host genomes in a copy-paste fashion.  LINE (Long INterspersed Element) and SINE (Short INterspersed Element) are two of the largest families of mammalian transposable elements and together account for more than half of all mammalian transposable elements.  LINEs encode genes required for their own mobilization, while SINEs are totally dependent on the genes of LINEs.  L1 (LINE-1) is the dominant LINE family in placental and marsupial mammals, while dominating SINE families diverge between different orders of mammals.  In rodents, B1 is the major SINE family.       Despite the fact that LINEs and SINEs compromise a quarter of a mammalian genome and they are occasionally co-adapt to serve host functions, they are found to have lost their activity at least eight million years ago in a group of species-rich South American rodents.  This group includes about 7% of all mammalian species.  Given B1s are dependent on L1, one would expect that their extinction to be simultaneous. We dissected the evolutionary history of L1 and B1 in the sigmodontine rodents and found that the last waves of L1 and B1 mobilizations preceding their respective extinction were the strongest in the detectable evolutionary history.  Unlike the originally hypothesized scenario where B1 extinction is caused by L1 quiescence, the extinction time window of B1 corresponds to the last and strongest wave of L1 mobilization.  The tempo of L1 and B1 mobilization before their extinction hints possible trigger of strong host regulation due to their volatile activity.

Evolutionary biologists studying patterns of biodiversity use these characteristics to describe species and quantify biodiversity, as well as to study the process of speciation. As part of the Co-PIÆs dissertation research at the University of Idaho, we were interested in studying the accumulation of these characteristics in the plant genus Bartsia, a member of the parasitic plant family Orobanchaceae. This group has approximately 45 species that grow above 13,000 ft., mostly in alpine ecosystems in South America. Specifically, we wanted to determine how the 45 species of Bartsia were related to each other, and use these evolutionary relationships as a basis for 1) understanding the origin of this diversity in Andean South America, 2) determining what traits were important for speciation in the group, and 3) updating the classification of the genus.  Using numerous samples collected by the Co-PI from throughout the range (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia), representing the morphological, geographic, and genetic diversity of all species of Bartsia, we used genetic (DNA sequence) data to determine the pattern of evolutionary relationships (phylogeny) of the group. However, to accomplish this, it was first necessary to develop new approaches for collecting the datasets necessary for elucidating the phylogeny of this group of closely related species. Advances in sequencing technologies &ndash; specifically high throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) &ndash; have made the creation of larger datasets possible, and this project was designed with that in mind. Although molecular systematics has benefited greatly with the advancements of HTS, all of the approaches that were being used for phylogenetic studies produce excessive amounts of uninformative data that is not suitable for phylogenetic systematics. Motivated by this, we developed a new approach to generate large amounts of data efficiently and affordably, but&mdash;most importantly&mdash; done in a way that we could decide which parts of the genome to sequence (i.e., targeted). To do this, we relied on the proven specificity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a method that selects and makes large amounts of copies of single regions in the genome. Traditionally, PCR is performed one region at a time, but taking advantage of newly available microfluidic technology, we were able to amplify 48 separate, targeted regions for 48 independent samples simultaneously, and sequence these using HTS technologies. We believe that by using targeted HTS approaches, systematists and evolutionary biologists can maximize the data that they can collect by decreasing the number of regions in the genomes that they choose and increasing the number of samples per run. If the regions are chosen wisely, all of the data generated by targeted HTS will be appropriate to answer systematic/phylogenetic questions.  Using this approach, we collected data from 48 regions of the maternally inherited chloroplast genome and 48 regions of the biparentally inherited nuclear genome for more than 500 samples, including all species of Bartsia and related genera in the plant family Orobanchaceae. Using the data from these sequencing experiments, we were able to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of all the species in the genus and place them in the context of related genera. From this, we discovered that the genus Bartsia, as currently circumscribed, does not form a group where all species are each otherÆs closest relatives (a primary goal of evolutionary-based classifications). As a result, we revised the taxonomy of the genus so that it better reflects our understanding of evolutionary relationships. Furthermore, we observed that the South American species of Bartsia are more closely related to several groups of European species, and were the only species within this much ..."

This tool, called Arbor Workflows, allows users to access, analyze, and understand the diversity of life on Earth. Built on a base that encourages reuse and sharing of data over the web, Arbor enables scientists to work together on projects spanning a wide range of applications.  The tools that we have built focus on understanding how species are related to one another, and how they differ from one another in the traits that they have and where they live. Our tools are visual and work over the web, allowing researchers to gather data from many sources in a visual and intuitive way.  For example, researchers can obtain data from the Encyclopedia of Life, a huge online database of the Earth's species, and combine it with data from the Open Tree of Life, an NSF-funded database on species relationships. They can then use Arbor to visualize patterns of similarity and differences across species, and test hypothesis about how the traits of those species are related to their environment.  Our planet faces an unprecidented biodiversity crisis. Arbor uses tools from computational biology to help understand the Earth's species, how they came to be, the factors influencing their distribution, and the threats that they face in the future.

"A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site award has been made to the Center for Research on Invasive Species and Small Populations (CRISSP) at the University of Idaho.  The project will provide training for 10 students for 9 weeks during the summers of 2012- 2014.  The program focuses on 1) threats posed by invasive species to natural and agricultural resources; 2) conservation challenges confronting small or declining populations of native species; and 3) connections between these two issue areas.  Student research takes an interdisciplinary, team-based approach with faculty mentors representing diverse disciplines from multiple departments and two colleges. Projects facilitate development of critical laboratory, field and data analysis skills while providing opportunity for interaction among students from different disciplines working under shared research themes.  In addition to conducting research, students will participate in weekly seminars and workshops designed to enhance understanding of interdisciplinary research, career/graduate school preparation, critical thinking, natural resource economics, and ethics.  Students have access to the laboratories of faculty mentors as well as many shared facilities such as the Geospatial Laboratory for Environmental Dynamics, the Idaho Stable Isotopes Laboratory, and the Laboratory for Ecological, Evolutionary and Conservation Genetics.  Recruitment is through NSF-REU and UI websites, as well as direct contacts with institutions serving diverse student bodies.  Faculty encourage applications from students from underrepresented groups through close collaboration with colleagues at Native American colleges and by working directly with the University Office of Multicultural Affairs, Native American Center, and Tribal Liaison.  Students are selected based on academic record and potential to successfully complete research in a team-setting.  Students' progress in academic programs, applications for graduate school or other professional opportunities, and preparation of scientific papers or presentations is monitored.  Facebook is used to facilitate communication among faculty and REU alumni.  Progress towards the project goals is assessed through metrics such as student degree completion, number of graduate school applications in STEM fields, as well as use of an REU common assessment tool.  More information is available by visiting (http://www.cnr.uidaho.edu/crissp/reugrant.htm), or by contacting the PI (Dr. Janet Rachlow at jrachlow@uidaho.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Jodi Johnson-Maynard at jmaynard@uidaho.edu).",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,302694.00,302694,4900,RSCH EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD SITES,1157099,,Janet L Rachlow,,Moscow,US,"ID""","University of Idaho, CRISSP",ID,838441136,jrachlow@uidaho.edu,Janet,Rachlow,,Amanda Simcox,,['01001213DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],03/12/2012,04/01/2012,03/31/2015,REU Site:  Interdisciplinary Approach to Challenges posed by Invasive Species,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Jodi L Johnson-Maynard', ""Michael R O'Rourke""]",L,," The Center for Research on Invasive Species and Small Populations (CRISSP) at the University of Idaho developed an interdisciplinary program for training undergraduate students (REU Site: Interdisciplinary Approach to Challenges posed by Invasive Species) that supported 30 undergraduate student researchers from across the country and Puerto Rico.  In addition, we leveraged our program success to enroll 3 additional students with funds from Idaho EPSCoR and other agencies, bringing the total number to 33 REU students mentored during the summers of 2012-2014.     Broader impacts of the CRISSP REU Site included contributing to diversity in the science workforce: 21% of the students in our program were from ethnic groups that are under-represented in the sciences, and 73% were women.  In addition to encouraging women and students from under-represented groups, we also successfully emphasized recruitment of students from small colleges and universities where research opportunities are limited: 70% of the CRISSP REU interns were from institutions that do not have advanced degree programs.   The CRISSP REU program was designed to help students from diverse backgrounds excel in careers in the natural sciences.  The REU interns not only conducted independent research guided by faculty mentors, but also participated in series of training activities aimed at 1) enhancing success in preparing for and completing graduate programs, 2) developing an appreciation and skills for participating in interdisciplinary research, and 3) exploring ethics and social dimensions of science, natural resource management, and conservation.  The REU interns also learned about science communication and then practiced these skills during a ""Science Saturdays in the Arboretum"" program that engaged GK-12 students and parents through outdoor educational activities.  Our aim was to help prepare these students to become leaders and effective science team members tackling complex environmental issues.  Intellectual merit of the CRISSP REU program was closely tied with the Center (CRISSP) where the REU interns were mentored.  Faculty in this multi-disciplinary Center work on basic and applied aspects of invasive species ecology and threatened species conservation.  Current and future natural and agricultural resource challenges are and will increasingly require scientists working across disciplines.  An explicit goal of the CRISSP REU program was enhancing the ability of students to address natural resource challenges by introducing the concepts and practice of interdisciplinary research.   The CRISSP REU program supported research conducted by students and mentors addressing emerging problems associated with invasion of non-native species and conservation of native plants and animals in both aquatic and terrestrial systems.  For example, students conducted surveys and evaluated of control methods for invasive aquatic species including New Zealand mud snails, Asian clams, non-native freshwater shrimp, and Didymosphenia geminata (also known as didymo or rock snot).  These non-native organisms are changing aquatic systems that support not only populations of native fishes, but also water resources for human and agricultural uses.  Students also worked with faculty to study invasive plants and to evaluate methods for their control, including use of native biocontrol agents (for example, insect predators like the tiger moth).   Because native plants and animals can be compromised by invasive species, CRISSP REU research also focused on native species of conservation concern.  Our students worked with Native America managers from the Nez Perce aquatic habitat restoration program to evaluate impacts of habitat changes and restoration on native steelhead trout populations on tribal lands.  Widespread conversion our local terrestrial ecosystem, the Palouse Prairie, has threatened several native plants and animals.  Student-led research in this ecosystem developed a predicti..."
"The project ""CI-TEAM Demo: Adventure Learning through Water and MOSS"" is engaging K-12 students throughout Idaho with meaningful inquiries into water resource issues through outdoor data-collection expeditions supported via a novel online learning environment. Students collect authentic data related to an inquiry-based curriculum and this data is shared within the online environment. Students, teachers, and content experts from throughout Idaho then communicate and collaborate in meaningful ways around data using the latest in low cost, high tech instrumentation. The McCall Outdoor Science School (MOSS) is serving as an informal science education provider and cornerstone to the project mission by serving as the base camp for water expeditions. Water expeditions are inquiry-driven and focus on various aspects of water resources inherent in the four seasons. MOSS also serves as the cyberlearning host for which online environment development is taking place. Seed funding through EPSCoR has provided the means to design initial web interface components (http://mossi.tfhsbruins.com/index/index/). <br/><br/>The current online learning environment is being redesigned, in part, using the Adventure Learning (AL) framework as defined by the work of the collaborating PI at the University of Texas, Austin.  AL is an approach to hybrid and online education that provides students with opportunities to investigate real-world issues through authentic learning experiences within collaborative learning environments. The AL framework consists of nine carefully integrated components, which, taken together, enable the development of an inquiry-based online learning environment. The online learning environment complements the curriculum, and together the two foster an organic learning experience that capitalizes on both the affordances of social technologies as well as on the opportunities provided by the outdoors for authentic learning. <br/><br/>The curriculum supporting these endeavors will be made available for free online. Additionally, access to the online learning environment will be provided free of charge to interested teachers throughout Idaho. Furthermore, the AL water expeditions will be designed to enable teachers from throughout Idaho the ability to conduct their own AL water expeditions in conjunction with the AL water expeditions being conducted at MOSS. While teachers and learners in other locations study the same topic, the online learning environment provides opportunities for collaboration and interaction between geographically dispersed participants. These locations are then enabled to conduct their own local exploration of the issue, share data and use the data from MOSS and other classes to support localized inquiries. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. Participating students in this project are developing and exercising key 21st century workforce skills. Authentic scientific inquiry leading to scientific literacy, as well as scientific skills will be developed in students. These skills include data collection, posing questions, making observations, inferring, and classifying. Students are also securing invaluable skills through their participation in the online learning environment, such as the ability to manage digital information and data, collaborate with others, and participate in virtual networks of practice. <br/><br/>Broader Impact. Many of the student groups participating in MOSS activities are underrepresented (e.g. American Indian, female, and rural). In addition, through the online environment many of the barriers to participation are eliminated for underrepresented students. Interest in this project has also been expressed by funded and potential projects. These expressions highlight the ripe potential for synergy around an online learning environment replete with social affordances that provide users with the opportunity to upload/input data and interact in meaningful ways around the data.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.080,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,170811.00,170811,4900,CI-TEAM,1135577,,Brant G Miller,"1800 University Lane, POBox 1025",McCall,US,ID01,University of Idaho - McCall Outdoor Science School,ID,836381025,bgmiller@uidaho.edu,Brant,Miller,achtchel@nsf.gov,Almadena Chtchelkanova,7032927498,['01001112DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],08/09/2011,01/01/2012,12/31/2013,Collaborative Research: CI-TEAM Demo: Adventure Learning through Water and MOSS,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Jan U Eitel', 'Karla Eitel']",G,," The Adventure Learning through Water and MOSS (AL@) project enabled K-12 students throughout Idaho to examine water resource issues through outdoor data-collection expeditions supported via a novel online learning environment (http://adventurelearningat.com). Students collected data, engaged in inquiry-driven activities, and shared data on the projectÆs online environment. Students, teachers, and content experts communicated and collaborated in meaningful ways around these data using low cost instrumentation. The McCall Outdoor Science School (MOSS) was the cornerstone to the project and served as an informal science education provider, acting as the basecamp for water expeditions. Water expeditions were inquiry-driven and focused on various aspects of water resources inherent in the four seasons.   Intellectual Merit Outcomes  The intended outcomes of the project were to increase student knowledge of and attitudes toward science, inquiry, and cybertechnology, increase student agency toward water conservation, and improve teacher attitudes toward science teaching and cybertechnology. All outcomes were achieved to differing degrees. The project partners collected a variety of quantitative and qualitative data to establish project outcomes. Student surveys indicated that the students who attended AL@MOSS showed improved attitudes toward science, and more sophisticated views towards (1) technology, and (2) the relationship between science and technology. Students also seemed to have stronger views regarding their ability to impact scientific concerns. It is reasonable to infer that changes related to perceptions of technology were related to the use of tablets, blogging, and other features of the AL@ website that students were exposed to during their time at MOSS. It is unclear whether changes in the studentsÆ perceptions of their ability to impact scientific concerns are related to their MOSS experience generally, or specifically related to organizing the MOSS program around the Adventure Learning framework through the CI-TEAM funded project.  The AL@ project also had an impact on teachers. Although statistical analyses did not show any differences in their views toward science teaching and technology, responses to open-ended items indicated that most teachers felt they would teach science and use technology differently after their time at MOSS. Numerous teachers also reported that they wanted to adopt MOSS-like teaching practices in the future by using more inquiry- and hands-on learning approaches. Many teachers also suggested they would like to use tablets, class blogs and the AL@ web resources upon returning to their classrooms after their MOSS experience, and that their time at MOSS gave them ideas to better utilize such technologies in their teaching. However, these findings are based on self-reported data and no follow up data were collected to determine whether actual changes in practice occurred. Most of the teachers interviewed were positive about tablets and blogging, even when they suggested they were apprehensive when they first heard those technologies were going to be incorporated into MOSSÆs programs. Many interviewees suggested they felt the technology changes at MOSS were valuable for student motivation and engagement, and served to broaden studentsÆ views of technology. Additionally, the teachers were quite positive regarding the role of the school blogs in allowing parents to stay connected with their childrenÆs activities at MOSS.  Broader Impact Outcomes  During the course of the AL@MOSS project 4,805 students participated in programming that used the AL@MOSS web environment. Of those students, approximately 708 students (15%) came from rural communities or could be considered underrepresented (e.g. Native American and Hispanic).  The web environment was used by projects beyond the scope of the initial NSF funding. Multiple and varied users denote the synergistic functionality of the web environment for co..."
"Interdisciplinary Studies of the Galapagos Earth System<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. This proposal is an accomplishment-based renewal of a grant that funded field-based research in volcanology, petrology, and geobiology in the Galápagos Archipelago. The new proposal is to continue these studies, but each component has newly designed hypotheses and field and laboratory studies to address those hypotheses. The volcanologic study is to fund 4 years of data acquisition of the 10-station continuous GPS network on Sierra Negra volcano. Sierra Negra has displayed remarkable extents (meter-scle) and geometries of surface deformation over the past 11 years. We hypothesize that the deformation is due to the filling and pressurization of a 1.9 km-deep subcaldera sill. The magma is accommodated by elastic domical uplift of the chamber?s roof, punctuated by trapdoor faulting. Because nearly the entire amount of deflation that accompanied the 2005 eruption has now been recovered, there is good reason to believe that an entire inter-eruptive cycle might be captured within the next few years, making the proposed measurements both timely and opportunistic. The Galápagos continues to be a natural laboratory for evolutionary studies and is a premier locality for understanding the relationship between the geologic template and biological evolution. This proposal will help fund two such studies. The first is to establish a paleogeographic history of the islands, which is crucial for understanding the phylogeographic pathways that relate diversified organisms. The paleogeographic models require an estimate of the age of emergence of the islands and their subsidence history. The second study will attempt to relate the geologic history of an island to the islands? biodiversity, which is measured by the species richness of taxonomic groups. These studies are in collaboration with biologists and have already yielded important results.  The third component of the proposal is a petrologic study of Rabida volcano. Rabida has erupted a diverse sequence of lavas, ranging from basalt to trachyte, and the volcanic deposits contain xenoliths of intrusive rocks. It is hypothesized that the xenoliths are from the mature and dying phases of the volcano?s history, thus their geochronology would establish the duration of volcanism at a Galápagos volcano, a crucial parameter for understanding the geologic history of the archipelago and one that is currently poorly constrained. The crystallization ages of the xenoliths will be measured by the U/Pb method, utilizing the ion microprobe at UCLA (other studies have shown that this is a robust method for oceanic xenoliths). The cumulate complement to the eruptive rocks will also test various hypotheses that have been put forth for the lithospheric evolution of Galápagos magmas. First, an evolutionary model has been proposed, and the compositions of the intrusive rocks should progress from primitive olivine gabbros to intermediate and evolved oxide-rich rocks. Second, the major petrogenetic processes have been proposed to be fractional crystallization and melt-crystal reaction in a thermally buffered mush column. The compositions of the xenoliths and their constituent minerals, determined by electron microprobe and LA ICPMS, will help evaluate these hypotheses. Having the intrusive complement to the erupted liquids in such a diverse suite is a rare opportunity. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The recently expired grant funded the thesis work of 2 undergraduate and 6 graduate students, each of whom has gone on to further graduate education or a career in science. Most of the students have been coauthors on papers, and all have presented their Galápagos work at international conferences. This renewal will enable a new set of students to pursue similar research. The grant will also help the PI to continue to assist several agencies of the Ecuadorian government in hazards assessment and volcano monitoring, and continue outreach efforts to the local population and U.S. schools.<br/><br/><br/>Panel Summary<br/> <br/>The panel concurred with mail reviewers positive assessment of the accomplishments made by the PI based on previous NSF funding for studies in the Galapagos.

This project consisted of three parts. The first was a study of eruptive rock and nodules of crustal rocks at Rabida volcano. The second was GPS monitoring of Sierra Negra volcano, which fortuitously erupted in 2018 and gave us one of the best records of pre-eruptive volcano deformation history in existence. The third was an ongoing study of the relationship between geologic history and biological evolution on the islands. Nodules from Rabida volcano are the complements to a basalt to rhyolite sequence. Despite the extraordinary differentiation, which requires efficient crystal-liquid segregation, the nodules show no evidence of compaction. GPS monitoring of Sierra Negra indicates that the caldera floor bulged by over 5 m after the 2005 eruption. This amount of deformation and the geometry of the deformation footprint indicates that the eruption was driven by the infilling of a shallow magma body and episodic faulting of the roof of the magma body. The biodiversity of each of the Galapagos Islands corresponds on a second order to its age. The most important control is island area, which is likely a measure of habitat diversity and carrying capacity. Age is a factor both due to evolution via adaptive radiation and the increased habitat diversity attributable to weathering and soil formation.

"Major Research Initiative in Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology:  Production of a Science Plan<br/>Judith Parrish-Jones, University of Idaho<br/>EAR-1157282<br/><br/>Over the last three decades, scientists who study the Earth?s sedimentary crust and the history of life have conducted innumerable workshops and produced dozens of white papers outlining critical research opportunities in the disciplines. This community may represent the most integrative part of the earth sciences. The community addresses issues of the history of life on Earth and the dynamics of evolution and extinction, the history of climate and climate dynamics, and the history of sedimentation and the dynamics of sedimentary basins. The entire record of climate and life is preserved in sedimentary rocks, and is understood through integrated studies of tectonics, climate, life, and sedimentology. Our sample of modern processes is limited, yet understanding of these processes is important to many societal concerns. Fundamental knowledge about these processes is recorded in the sedimentary record. Without understanding the full range of process behavior we do not truly understand processes such as climate change, extinction, and resource distribution and quality. This workshop will integrate research opportunities identified by the community over the last several years in order to provide a framework for moving forward with major research initiatives.

The science plan was produced and titled ""TRANSITIONS:  The Changing Earth-Life System--Critical Information for the Future from the Deep Past.""  Deep past is defined as Earth's history before about 2 million years ago.  Major climatic, environmental, and life transitions have occurred during this time that exceed in magnitude and signficance any events during the last 2 million years, yet our understanding of deep-time events remains poor.  Recent work has revealed that the Earth may have experienced radically different states--modes of operation--in the deep past, and understanding these modes is vital for anticipating future changes.  The report outlines 3 critical tools needed for progress--continental scientific drilling, improved geochronological methods, and community databases and sample archives--and three avenues of research most likely to lead to significant discoveries:  deep-time climate, landscapes, and biology and environments.  The science plan recommends the funding of large, interdisciplinary teams working together on critical transitions in Earth history.  As of this writing, the science plan may be accessed through the Society for Sedimentary Geology (SEPM; www.sepm.org) or Paleontological Society (www.paleosoc.org) websites.  Based partly on the science plan, the National Science Foundation established a new funding program, ""Earth-Life Transitions"" (under the Sedimentary Geology and Paleontology program), which, in 2013, funded several interdisciplinary research teams to tackle important events throughout deep time.  Graduate students, postdocs, and early career faculty were critical parts of this effort and have gone on to demonstrate leadership in this science going forward.

"Chemical and isotopic signatures allow us to age rocks, follow the fate and transport of nutrients, reconstruct climate trends and study the migratory behaviors of animals.  As the need for high precision isotopic techniques in the geological, ecological and climate sciences increases, it is critical to have both the research infrastructure to address regional research needs as well as the ability to train students on state-of-the-art equipment.  This proposal is for the acquisition of a Multi-Collector Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer (MC-TIMS) at the University of Idaho.  This major acquisition is intended to foster an interdisciplinary regional center for isotope geochemistry and environmental tracers, the Palouse Biogeosciences Collaborative (PBC), which would support a wide array of ecological, biogeochemical and geological studies and would fill a critical research and training need within the 3 partnering universities; the University of Idaho (UI), Washington State University (WSU) and Eastern Washington University (EWU). The methodological development and application of environmental and isotopic tracers is an existing regional strength as evidenced by several interdisciplinary research groups focused on isotopic analyses of large-scale ecological, atmospheric, geologic, and hydrologic phenomena.  Investment in the new MC-TIMS technology will enable us to build on this existing strength while we strategically foster research programs that expand jointly across the three campuses. A Thermo Fisher Scientific MC-TIMS, the Triton Plus along with the requested New Wave Micromill will provide the capacity for high-precision and high resolution sampling for isotopic analyses of geologic and biological materials. The requested instrument will enable researchers to quantify the isotopes of solid-state, low-ionization elements such as Nd, Pb, Ca, and Sr to understand origins, fates and transport of materials from systems across spatial scales to better understand the life history migratory salmon, the provenance of metamorphic belts, the origin and evolution of magmas, and the source of atmospheric pollutants.  Examples of collaborative, interdisciplinary efforts that will be supported include employing geochemical techniques and geologic principles to understand the diversity and evolution of salmon migration in the Columbia River.<br/><br/>Three major integrated elements of this funded award include: 1) a Multi-collector Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer (TIMS) designed specifically for the high precision analysis of radiogenic and cosmogenic isotope ratios; 2) a Retarding Potential Quadropole (RPQ) Lens, which provides a selective filter for ions that are in high abundance and influence the resolution of neighboring ions; and 3) a New-Wave Micromill for high spatial resolution microsampling of solid materials such as melt inclusions, volcanic crystals, and fish otoliths or earstones.  Funding will complement existing facilities at UI and WSU, establishing a powerful regional consortium for training and engagement of isotopic and environmental tracers.  The acquisition of a MC-TIMS and emerging partnerships with new faculty at UI (Harpp) and young investigators at EWU (Nezat), will galvanize a concerted effort to 1) create an interdisciplinary program in biogeosciences that spans fields of ecology, biogeochemistry, and geologic sciences and 2) recruit female students into the field of isotope geochemistry.  This critical mass of instrumentation and personnel will provide the tools and resources to offer comprehensive programs for training, outreach and engagement of undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers across the region. The collaborators propose a new, unique set of integrated undergraduate and graduate courses as well as workshops to maximize the impact of the instrumentation.

As the need for high precision isotopic analytical techniques in the geological, ecological and climate sciences increases, it is critical to have both the research infrastructure to address regional research needs as well as the ability to train students on state-of-the-art equipment.  To this end, the major goals of this project have been to 1) acquire a multi-collector Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer (TIMS), with a micromill for precise sampling, to facilitate isotopic analysis of geologic and biological materials, 2) install the TIMS and its ancillary components into an integrated research facility that accommodates a diverse spectrum of users with interdisciplinary applications, and 3) facilitate the research and educational objectives of a regional radiogenic isotope research facility.   This major instrumental acquisition and installation have been guided by the goal of fostering an interdisciplinary regional center for isotope geochemistry and environmental tracers, the Palouse Biogeosciences Collaborative (PBC), which currently supports a wide array of ecological, biogeochemical and geological studies, and fills a critical research and training need within the three partnering universities; the University of Idaho (UI), Washington State University (WSU) and Eastern Washington University (EWU).

The TIMS (IsotopX ?Phoenix?) specifications were trial tested in Manchester, UK, in 2012 with a final purchase decision made in 2013. Temporary challenges identifying suitable environment at the University of Idaho necessitated a 2-year loan agreement with WSU, where the instrument was delivered, installed and calibrated in the spring of 2015. The final achievement of the project, beginning in the summer of 2017, has been the completion of an instrument move into a brand-new LEED Gold-certified, interdisciplinary science building (Integrated Research and Innovation Center &ndash; IRIC) on the University of Idaho campus. The new climate-controlled laboratory now provides an extremely stable environment in which to operate the equipment and prepare samples, with notable results demonstrating improved stability and higher performance of the instrumentation. The new location also provides a highly visible analytical facility in an open, collaborative environment complete with great campus exposure. The move has galvanized the efforts of multiple groups at the University of Idaho to create an ultra-clean sample preparation laboratory in the same building housing the Phoenix. The new facility features two large laminar flow hoods (Class 100) purchased through NSF Idaho &ndash; EPSCoR funding (to co-PI Harpp) and will provide a unique chemically suitable (ultra-clean) preparation space for samples to be analyzed in the TIMS laboratory.   The TIMS laboratory has been chemically preparing and running standards and samples for Sr and Nd isotope systems routinely over the past two years, and in the months following the final installation and calibration. The Sr and Nd isotope work has included the chemical purification and preparation of samples for mass spectrometry of over 200 total client samples. University projects include the study of salmon migration, the geochronology and tectonic evolution of the region, the chemical weathering of Mount St. Helens drainages and the connectivity of high elevation paleolakes (~40 million years) based upon the stratigraphy of lacustrine carbonates. Client samples have included stream waters collected from various North American and South American watersheds, carbonate (shell) samples from the Salmon River, silicate and phosphate rocks, and mineral digestions including USGS standards. In addition to the chemical preparation and analyses of client samples, a long-term record of standards has been continuously updated in order to provide the users of the facility with an up-to-date indication of the instrument performance and precision, as well as the success of the laboratory chemical protocols. Precision on standards has exceeded the manufacturer?s specifications (3ppm 1RSD for Sr).  Despite the relatively short time that the Phoenix has been operational, it has served as the basis for one WSU graduate-level course (Geology 597 &ndash; TIMS technique and application) and has contributed to two graduate student research projects (MS &ndash; D. Gurganus, PhD &ndash; J. Hegg).   Since the re-installation of the Phoenix at its new location, the instrument is now fully functional and running routine analyses nearly fully automatically, and even remotely. Client interest has continued to increase outside of the WSU and UI lab groups and currently involves requests for clean sample preparation and analyses to be performed. This interest has formed the basis for a new service center in development as well as newly developed, stream-lined chemical separation techniques for samples that have been successfully tested and applied routinely to incoming client samples.

"Our understanding of the processes through which species adapt to one another is largely predicated upon the assumption that interactions between species depend on only single traits. However, real interactions, including those with implications for human health and agriculture, inevitably involve multiple traits. The primary reason multiple traits have not been integrated into existing theory is the sheer difficulty of developing and analyzing appropriate mathematical models. The proposed work will overcome existing hurdles by developing powerful new mathematical tools that allow a general theory of multivariate coevolution to be formulated. These tools will be made widely available to the scientific community through presentations at annual meetings and publication of electronic Mathematica appendices.<br/><br/>In addition to significantly advancing our understanding of how species adapt to one another, the proposed work will promote undergraduate and graduate training at the interface of biology and mathematics. A team of students recruited into the University of Idaho's Undergraduates in Biological and Mathematical Sciences program will be trained in basic computational and mathematical approaches through work on this project.

A long standing puzzle within evolutionary biology has been the observation that parasites, despite their large population sizes and short generation times, do not seem to evolve more rapidly than their hosts. What mechanisms, then, prevent parasite populations from adapting so well to their hosts that they drive them to extinction? The research conducted as part of this award explored the idea that the evolutionary playing field is leveled by mechanisms of parasite resistance that involve multiple traits or lines of defense. Using a combination of mathematical models and computer simulations, research on this award demonstrated that when a parasite must overcome multiple host defensive traits in order to infect, the evolutionary playing field can be tipped in favor of the host, potentially explaining why parasites do not inevitably evolve and adapt more rapidly than their victims. Subsequent research expanded these results by developing more general mathematical tools that can be used to explore multi-trait coevolution between any pair of interacting species, including other types of interactions such as those between predators and prey or between mutualists.  Over the course of this award, important contributions were also made to the development of a highly trained scientific workforce with expertise at the interface of mathematics and biology. Specifically, work on this award trained a graduate student with an undergraduate degree in mathematics how to use tools from mathematics to solve important biological problems. Over the course of their graduate education, this student published two papers in scientific journals before graduating with a MS in bioinformatics and computational biology. This student is now working on a PhD in the research lab of a MacArthur Genius Award winner and member of the National Academy of Sciences. In addition to this training at the graduate level, multiple undergraduate students from a range of academic backgrounds were integrated into this research.

"Phenotypic heterogeneity (aka phenotypic or phase variation) occurs when a subset of organisms in a population regulate a reversible switch that allows them to express alternate sets of cellular components. Myxococcus xanthus is a soil-dwelling, antibiotic-producing, bacterium whose dramatic social activities, including swarm expansion and development, have yielded a wealth of information about cell-cell interactions, signaling and multicellular cooperative behavior. These social processes are linked intimately with the ability of M. xanthus cells to undergo phase variation, which produces two inter-convertible cell types, called yellow and tan, that differ greatly in their abilities to swarm, survive, and develop. Wild-type colonies exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity because they contain a mixture of yellow, swarming and tan, non-swarming variants. Remarkably, both yellow and tan variants are critical for long-term survival of the population, which demonstrates that phenotypic heterogeneity in M. xanthus evolved a fail-safe mechanism to ensure the maintenance cell type survival. This research is aimed at using molecular, genetic, and bioinformatic and computational tools to elucidate the mechanism that allows M. xanthus cells to undergo this remarkable yellow to tan switch with the long-range goal of understanding the biological interplay between the two cell types. Toward this goal, the function of genes whose expression is phase dependent will be characterized and the regulators of phase variation, including the master regulator, will be identified. Because phenotypic variation affects multiple aspects of the M. xanthus lifecycle, the results of these experiments may lead to a coherent model showing how Myxococcus xanthus coordinates its social developmental pathways.

This remarkable plasticity can help the organism adapt to changing environments allowing it to, for example, escape death (pathogens and host immunity) and nutrient depletion.  In Myxococcus xanthus, phase variation yields two cell types, PV1 (yellow) and PV2 (tan), that are important for the development of myxospores, the quiescent cells needed for long term survival of the organism.    The major goals of the project were to identify significant molecular differences between the two PV cell types in M. xanthus and to reveal the mechanism underlying the switch that regulates phase variation.  Experiments were designed to identify genes regulated differentially in PV1 and PV2 cells and determine the specific roles played by these genes and their products in the phenotypes that are affected by phase variation including pigmentation, swarming, fruiting body development and sporulation (aim 1).  Additional experiments were designed to identify regulators of phase variation and components involved in PV signal transduction (aim 2).  The broader impacts of the project were to train undergraduate students to conduct independent research and present their work at a scientific meeting and to raise awareness about the role of phase variation and the significance of the PV2 (tan variant) cells during studies on growth and development of M. xanthus.   The results of this study showed that expression of genes for production of the antibiotic myxovirescin (TA), which is needed for predation, and for the production of the protective yellow pigment called DKX, which is needed for formation of myxospores, is significantly increased in PV1 cells relative to PV2 cells.  PV2 cells are tan (nonpigmented) because they do not express the dkx genes and they do not produce DKX.  However, the PV2 cells need DKX (presumably obtained from dead PV1 cells) in order to differentiate into spores when nutrients are lacking.  PV2 cells also are unable to produce TA, and do not display predatory behavior. Instead, PV2 cells specialize in producing compounds for sequestration of iron.  Limiting iron in the medium stimulates M. xanthus cells to switch from PV2 (yellow) to PV1 (tan) and addition of the antibiotic TA also stimulates the PV2 to PV1 switch.  Analysis of mutants suggests that a small RNA species plays a role in regulating the iron sequestration processes in PV2 cells.  While information about the switch from PV2 (tan) to PV1 (yellow) is still being investigated, there is evidence that the AsgB protein, known historically for its role in cell-cell signaling during development, is needed for the PV2 to PV1 switch.  Significant results are mentioned above and are summarized here:  Under normal nutrient conditions, PV1 cells, but not PV2 cells, express genes for DKX, myxovirescin and other putative secondary metabolites. PV2 cells express products needed for iron acquisition; they shut off synthesis of secondary metabolites. Addition of iron (FeCl3) stabilizes the PV1 cells indefinitely and increases antibiotic production per mg of cell protein. Removal of iron causes PV1 cells to phase vary to PV2 state but addition of iron does not stimulate the reverse reaction.  Antibiotic TA also stimulates PV1 to PV2 switch but the mechanism is unclear because a ?ta mutant is still able to phase vary and it responds to low iron concentrations.   Three Xre-HTH DNA binding proteins have been shown to regulate branches of this pathway. One of these, Xre0228, is a positive regulator of the dkx and ta pathways.  PV2 (tan) cells play a unique role in myxobiology because the persist in vegetative cultures long after the PV1 cells have died and they disproportionately contribute to the myxospore population during development. Twelve undergraduate students spent at least 1-2 years (each) working in the laboratory on this project.  The majority of these students have gone on to professional and graduate schools in STEM.          Last Modified: 08/09/2016       Submitted by: Patricia L Hartzell"
"Over the last three decades, scientists who study the Earth?s sedimentary crust and the history of life have conducted innumerable workshops and produced dozens of white papers outlining critical research opportunities in the disciplines. This community may represent the most integrative part of the earth sciences. The community addresses issues of the history of life on Earth and the dynamics of evolution and extinction, the history of climate and climate dynamics, and the history of sedimentation and the dynamics of sedimentary basins. The entire record of climate and life is preserved in sedimentary rocks, and is understood through integrated studies of tectonics, climate, life, and sedimentology. Our sample of modern processes is limited yet understanding of these processes is important to many societal concerns. Fundamental knowledge about these processes is recorded in the sedimentary record. Without understanding the full range of process behavior we do not truly understand processes such as climate change, extinction, and resource distribution and quality. This workshop will integrate research opportunities identified by the community over the last several years in order to provide a framework for moving forward with major research initiatives.<br/>Intellectual merit: The consolidation of the common themes put forth by the sedimentary geology and paleontology community will provide focus for a major research initiative in critical areas.<br/>Broader impacts: Much of the community?s work is focused on societal concerns such as earth resources, climate change, and extinctions. This work can be carried forward with much greater impact if the initiatives to be framed here go forward.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,18000.00,23030,4900,Sedimentary Geo & Paleobiology,1129111,,Judith T Parrish,,,US,ID00,University of Idaho,ID,838443020,jparrish@uidaho.edu,Judith,Parrish,,H.

Sedimentary geologists and paleobiologists play critical roles in many areas of public concern, from exploration for sedimentary rock-based resources (oil, gas, coal, and many others) to climate change.  The workshop participants reviewed reports spanning more than 10 years and found that the community has consistently emphasized one major intellectual challenge.  This challenge is that we do not fully understand the full range within which Earth processes operate, and that the reason for that is that funding has emphasized study of the last 2 million years, during which Earth processes have operated within a very narrow range.  In addition, in order to fully understand these processes, the community requires three critical tools:  continental drilling, which allows us to access important, pristine, high-resolution records of past climates; geochronology, which allows us to put precise dates on these records; and cyperinfrastructure, including interoperable databases.  An example of why this work is important is that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere today are much higher than they have been at any time in the last 2 million years.  The last time carbon dioxide was this high was 23 million years ago.  Thus, to understand how climate is likely to respond to rising carbon dioxide levels, we need to be studying climate change that old and older.  As a result of this workshop, the participants sought funding for a larger workshop to write a science plan for a funding initiative to accomplish this work.

"The University of Idaho, with collaborators from Boise State and Idaho State Universities, is awarded a grant to facilitate field station infrastructure and inter-institutional collaboration building at the McCall Field Station.  The McCall Field Station is a key station in the region for conducting research and delivering educational outreach programs addressing issues of climate and land-use changes on terrestrial and aquatic processes that influence landscape connectivity and biodiversity (http://www.cnrhome.uidaho.edu/default.aspx?pid=41794). With high-impact educational and outreach programs currently in place, the primary goal now is to develop the research capacity of the Field Campus and carefully integrate this into the education/outreach activities.  <br/><br/>The project will develop a five-year strategic plan that will increase the quality of and capacity for research and scientific inquiry at the Field Campus.  The planning process will be informed by guidance from the Organization of Biological Field Stations and by an advisory group comprised of current and former directors of field stations. The effort will be integrated with that of a University advisory committee established to develop a strategic direction for the McCall Field Campus in concert with two other UI facilities: the Taylor Wilderness Research Station and the Nokes Experimental Forest. The advisory committee is comprised of leading UI scientists along with scientists from other state institutions (Boise State University and Idaho State University). <br/><br/>The effort will result in a research strategic plan under the umbrella of the McCall Field Campus vision and mission.  The plan will include including strategic foci, collaborations, key participants, a facilities/infrastructure plan, and a financial/business plan.  The strategic plan will capitalize on field campus strengths, including location, access to wildlands, fundraising success, and high-impact outreach and education programs.  It will optimize regional scientific opportunities and capitalize on opportunities presented the Taylor Wilderness Research Station and the Nokes Experimental Forestas as well as other field stations in the region.  A variety of stakeholders including University of Idaho higher administration, university and visiting researchers, other Idaho universities, other field stations, institutes and non-profit organizations, will participate in this process.<br/><br/>This strategic plan is an important step in the development of a research coordination network in the region that is characterized by large federal and state protected areas (national parks and wildernesses, national forests, state parks) embedded in complex mosaics of mountain and range habitats with steep elevational and latitudinal gradients of temperature and precipitation.  Large blocks of roadless areas, coupled with largely undeveloped river bottoms of the upstream segments of three great rivers of North America (Columbia, Missouri, Saskatchewan), provide linkage corridors that have important ecological and economic functions that maintain the natural and cultural attributes of the regional landscape.  However, the entire region is undergoing environmental and economic change as agricultural and forest lands convert to exurban uses and climate warming reduces snowpacks and lengthens growing seasons.

Research activity at the Research Station will build upon the vastly diverse environments that can be found throughout the Intermountain West. Scholars will conduct basic and applied research that focuses on ecological and physical processes that occur within the social and economic contexts of the Intermountain West. The research at the field station will inform decision making and will help protect valuable natural resources for future generations by developing improved management practices and monitoring the integrity and function of the natural environment. The research enterprise itself will allow citizen-scientists, undergraduate, and graduate students to get hands-on research experience and to connect to a wide variety of different research projects and researchers. Research will occur through a close, in-house connection to the McCall Outdoor Science School, a powerful engine for public outreach and engagement that hosts 2,500 K-12 students and teachers in immersive place-based learning experiences annually.  This connection will enable scientists and students to communicate their science to a diverse and lay audience to increase the general publicÆs science literacy and awareness. The science produced will help to further our scientific understanding of ecological and socio-economic interrelations of the diverse environments of the Intermountain West that provides the knowledge basis necessary for decision makers (e.g. government agency, industry, politicians) to sustainably manage regional ecosystems for the prosperity and well-being of its current and future residents.

For each yearÆs cohort, variety in the studentsÆ experiences was sought to maximize their exposure to a variety of experiences. The students included one female student each year and one student from a traditionally underrepresented group. They were from all sizes and types of colleges and universities; large public and private institutions to small public and private schools, including one student from a community college.  The goals of the University of Idaho Physics REU program were to provide quality and substantive research experiences to undergraduate students, encourage the studentsÆ identification as fellow scientists, and increase their likelihood of pursuing a career in a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics) field.  These students spent nine weeks working closely with a faculty mentor on a research project closely related to the scholarship of the mentor.  The eight faculty members who acted as mentors performed scholarship in the following areas: computational bio-physics, cratering mechanisms on other planets, band-gap engineering of wide band-gap oxide semiconductors, controlled carrier doping of nanowires, synthesis and characterization of magnetic nanoparticles and nanosprings, and controlled de-alloying to create nano-porous membranes.  Community building among the REU students and the other students and faculty of the department was a major component of the program. The students lived in a dorm on campus where they would share their experiences and their research with each other and the students participating in another REU program on campus (in biology). Weekly lunches provided opportunities for the students to get to know the faculty of the department in a more informal atmosphere and learn more about the life and career of scientists. One of the weekly lunches provided the opportunity to discuss the issue of scientific ethics in research. During the course of the summer, five excursions were planned for the benefit of the students. These provided further opportunities for the students to bond with two of the excursions having a scientific theme that included the geological and natural history of the Inland Pacific Northwest.  At the end of the summer, each student wrote up a description of the work they had performed over the summer; their research goals, results and skills learned. The skills the students learned included how to operate complex research tools (e.g. vacuum pumps, test and measurement equipment, data acquisition tools), how to design experiments, how to keep a laboratory notebook and how to perform literature searches. The students also had to give a ten-minute oral presentation modeled on those given at the American Physical Society March Meeting.  Exit surveys of the students revealed that all of the students after having participated in the University of Idaho Physics REU program were either newly convinced that pursing a STEM career and further STEM studies was best for them or that their experience further reinforced their decision to pursue a career in a STEM field.

The training provided to these students allowed many of them to move on to graduate programs, to publish their work in scientific journals, and to present their work at scientific conferences. Further, we were highly successful in recruiting women into the program, which is a desirable broader impact considering that women are an underrepresented group in mathematics.

"As the Earth's climate warms over the next century, ecosystems throughout the northern hemisphere also will be exposed to elevated rates of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. Understanding this complex environmental change lies at the heart of our ability to anticipate the degree to which forests will sequester human-produced carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. An interdisciplinary team of scientists will investigate the interaction between climate warming and simulated atmospheric N deposition using a long-term, regional-based, field experiment located in sugar maple-dominated forest ecosystems common throughout eastern North America. Over the past 10 years, simulated atmospheric nitrogen deposition at rates expected to occur by 2050 have increased tree growth and slowed the decay of dead leaves and roots, increasing the amount of carbon stored in this wide-spread ecosystem. However, it is uncertain whether carbon storage will stabilize at a higher equilibrium over the long-term as atmospheric nitrogen deposition increases, or whether expected warming will counteract this effect. The proposed research will quantify the amounts of carbon stored in overstory trees, forest floor and soil over the next decade, allowing this team of scientists to test hypotheses regarding the interaction of climate warming and atmospheric nitrogen deposition on ecosystem carbon sequestration. <br/><br/>The results of this project will be disseminated to other global change scientists, K-12 teachers, and the general public through the development of user-friendly, web-based tools. In addition the team of investigators will continue conducting the annual Global Change Teachers Institute.

Much of this nitrogen is later deposited onto temperate forests located downwind from emission sources. Because nitrogen is an essential nutrient, nitrogen deposition has the potential to alter the ecological function of temperate forests and increase ecosystem carbon (C) storage, but the extent of these impacts is unclear. To understand the impact of nitrogen deposition, and its interaction with climate change, we have conducted a long-term collaborative experiment in the north central United States.  To simulate potential future increases in atmospheric nitrogen deposition, four sugar maple (Acer saccharum)-dominated northern hardwood study sites have received annual additions of nitrogen (3 g of NO3--N/m2) since 1994. During the first 14 years of this experiment, simulated nitrogen deposition increased forest productivity, while causing soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (respiration) and plant litter decomposition to decline. These responses have increased the amount of carbon stored in trees and the soil. At the beginning of our LTREB award in 2008, we hypothesized that: i) simulated nitrogen deposition would continue to accelerate tree growth, ii) simulated nitrogen deposition would continue to cause surface soil carbon to accumulate at a faster rate; iii) warmer temperatures would accelerate forest productivity across the climatic gradient encompassed by the study sites; and, iv) climate warming would interact with simulated nitrogen deposition to differentially increase ecosystem carbon storage among sites. We tested these hypotheses using established long-term measurements as well as new investigations into the litter decomposition.  During the past five years, forest growth has been 12% greater under simulated nitrogen deposition. Since 2006, average annual growth across all sites has been slightly lower. This is due, in part, to the occurrence of several of the driest late summers (July and August) in our years of record, in combination with significant insect defoliation events at two sites. In the absence of such conditions, these forests still have very high annual growth. For example, our southernmost site has not experienced defoliation, had sufficient moisture from 2008 through 2010, and had very high growth during those years. Simulated nitrogen deposition has caused the greatest increase in aboveground tree biomass at the coolest, northernmost site. Our long-term measurements of forest nitrogen cycling reveal that the higher levels of ambient nitrogen deposition present in the more southern sites have increased nitrogen availability, so the weaker response to simulated nitrogen deposition could be evidence that ambient nitrogen deposition has affected these sites.  For soil carbon accumulation, our most recent (2009) inventory of soil carbon was consistent with the greater soil carbon storage we documented in 2004. However, it was unclear whether increased soil carbon storage resulted from slower decomposition or a reduced extent of decomposition. To determine which of these processes was important, we conducted model simulations based on both scenarios. These simulations indicated that a reduced extent of litter decay was responsible for the accumulation soil carbon under simulated nitrogen deposition. The decrease in litter decay under simulated nitrogen deposition has also thickened the forest floor, which has apparently increased the mortality of sugar maple seedlings and caused a shift in the composition of the tree seedling community. In the long-term, this may negatively impact sugar maple regeneration and favor the establishment of other species.  In addition to investigating simulated nitrogen deposition, we have been able to use these study sites to understand how decadal changes in air pollution have affected forest chemistry.

Through partnerships with the Idaho Regional Optical Network (IRON), more institutions now have high-speed bandwidth connectivity to the Internet.  In addition, increased institutional participation in IRON within Idaho now provides more high-speed connections between education and research facilities within the State.  Strategic investments have improved Internet connectivity across Idaho:  North Idaho College (NIC) / University of Idaho (UI) Harbor Center &ndash; Access to high speed Internet and enhanced videoconferencing capabilities were implemented (e.g., the UI facility has 100 times more Internet capacity).  The project provided many mutual benefits to the higher-education institutions in northern Idaho, including increased collaboration and joint use of facilities. Lewis Clark State College (LCSC) &ndash; Access to high-speed Internet and state-of-the-art video capabilities resulted in improved distance education delivery. This enabled video conferencing network traffic for multiple simultaneous video classrooms in high definition. College of Southern Idaho (CSI) &ndash; Significant improvements have been made to desktop and wireless Internet speeds.  The network responsiveness and availability to faculty, instructional computing labs, and wireless networks at the main CSI campus and their branch campuses has been greatly improved.  Network upgrades greatly enhanced CSIÆs ability to support math and science learning and research and have improved services to rural Idaho students.  Idaho State University (ISU) &ndash; Network improvements access to IRON improved collaboration between ISU and affiliate research centers including the University of Idaho, Boise State University, Idaho Education Network, Idaho National Laboratory, and the Center for Advanced Energy Studies with significantly improved bandwidth and redundant links to the Internet. This has expanded ISUÆs effectiveness in creating educational opportunities for students, faculty, administrators, and research staff.    Idaho also now has a well-organized structure for sharing of data because of a strategic planning effort that resulted in a State Cyberinfrastructure Strategic Plan for Idaho universities.  In partnership with the Idaho National Laboratory, a new tenure-track faculty member at the University of Idaho, specializing in data architecture, was hired and is providing expertise for IdahoÆs growing data management initiatives, including the Northwest Knowledge Network (NKN).  This project also contributed to creation of a data portal (housed at the NKN) to increase access and improve management of data. Improved connectivity is helping Idaho institutions reach a broader audience.  With better Internet connections, distance learning is better meeting the needs of underrepresented and rural students. The increased bandwidth and video conferencing now enables improved delivery of video courses for distance education, participation and delivery of dual credit courses through the State's Idaho Education Network (IEN), improved access to college resources for current and prospective students, improved access for employees and students to materials for work and research, and increased ability for faculty to participate in research.

The goals of this degree program are to (1) Contribute to the national and regional workforce; (2) Produce a workforce equipped for the environmental challenges of the 21st century; (3) Produce science ambassadors, trained in ethics and effective communication; and (4) Produce Native American professional scientists.   The program was launched with the support of this grant in the fall of 2010.  The vast majority of grant funds were awarded as fellowships to selected students in the first two years of the program (i.e., students starting in 2010 and 2011). At the conclusion of the grant, the program had produced 20 graduates equipped for the environmental challenges of the 21st century.  These graduates had been educated in ethics, science communication and the management of scientific projects and innovation, in addition to core environmental science and/or water resource concepts.  Three of these graduates were Native Americans.   In addition, at the end of the grant period the program had 21 students enrolled and making progress toward completion of their PSM degrees.  Two of these students were Native Americans.   Our graduates have taken jobs with a variety of governmental, non-governmental and business organizations.  One of our graduates has started her own environmental consulting business and two of our graduates are pursuing law degrees with a focus on environmental and water law.  In addition to providing support for many of the initial students in the program, funding from this grant has allowed the University of Idaho to develop a strong PSM program that is positioned to continue to produce graduates who are equipped to meet the environmental challenges of the 21st century and are prepared to be science ambassadors.  Our program now includes eight tracks within the environmental and water sciences, and arrangements have been created with the University of Idaho law school so that a student can pursue a joint J.D./PSM degree in any one of these tracks.  Our PSM tracks are as follows:  Environmental Contamination Sustainability Science Climate Change Water Resources Management Management of Regulated River Systems Ecohydrological Science and Management Bioenergy and Bioproducts Sustainable Food &amp; Fiber   In addition to taking graduate level science courses in the studentÆs chosen track, students are required to take four professional skills courses that were developed specifically for the PSM program with help from the grant.  All of these courses have been created in an online delivery format to serve our PSM students wherever they are located.  Those four courses are:  Bus 551 Managing Scientific Projects Bus 552 Managing Scientific Innovation Eng 522 Communication for Science Professionals Phil 504 Ethical Practice in Natural Resource &amp; Environmental Science   The grant funds have also helped us build the sustaining infrastructure needed to continue to deliver a strong PSM program into the future.

This award (NSF DUE-0942497) enabled us to create a responsive and award-winning website that currently hosts more than 180 videos focused on interviews with notable researchers in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology. In response to a phone survey of more than 90 instructors of cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience at different institutions all across the United States and with the help of this NSF award we have interviewed 18 leading scientists about their research and other, general questions within the field of cognitive neuroscience (see figure 2).  One of the goals of this project was the integration of undergraduate and graduate students in the creation of teaching resources for cognitive neuroscience. Apart from graduate student support at the University of Idaho, four additional students from different institutions contributed to the planning and production of video interviews.  In addition to the video interviews, the website also offers online demonstrations and online experiments to illustrate important cognitive principles. The provided materials can be easily searched and filtered by associated tags, and related videos are grouped into chapters allowing for easy browsing and sequential viewing.  Usage of the website has grown substantially over the duration of the grant (2010-2014). Depending on the metrics used, site traffic and page views have increased 600-1,000% since 2010 (see figure 3).

Participating students from Idaho will work in small, vertically integrated, interdisciplinary teams (2-3 students) within the Andean Region of southern Ecuador, addressing individual research questions focused around an umbrella theme of biodiversity conservation and sustainable community development.  Specific projects include the conservation genetics of endangered Andean species, biodiversity assessment and restoration of endangered orchids, international protected areas management and policy, and invertebrate taxa as bioindicators in regional watersheds.  UI graduate students will serve as team leaders, while UTPL faculty and staff, coordinated by research vice-rector Dr. Juan Pablo Suárez, will serve as project leads. <br/><br/>Southern Ecuador is noteworthy for its geographic, ecological, and cultural richness, and yet baseline knowledge is lacking for much of the country's natural heritage. This project's multinational research team encompasses expertise in landscape and organismal ecology, conservation biology, molecular systematics, landscape genetics, watershed management, environmental sociology, policy, sustainable community development, and education. Through targeted application of this expertise, the project will contribute to strategic conservation planning in the United States and other countries.

In the process, weÆve built long-term research partnerships, collected critical ecological and social data, and trained a cohort of international conservation professionals who will contribute to science and society for many years.  Our study region near Loja, Ecuador is one of the most diverse places on earth, with a rich tapestry of ethnicities and indigenous groups, and with a geography that evolves from Pacific coastal dry forest into high Andean tundra, and then down to the Amazonian rainforest&hellip; all within a distance of less than 100 miles. Biodiversity levels are staggering. At the same time, it is an area undergoing rapid cultural and ecological change- often in the absence of basic natural history information, or a comprehensive understanding of human needs and social dynamics in the area.  With funding from the National Science Foundation, we have sought to address some of these knowledge gaps through student driven research. In 2011, faculty from UI and UTPL identified three areas where students could work in teams to address cutting-edge, rigorous scientific questions in biodiversity conservation, aquatic ecology, social sciences, and population demography and genetics. However, students were trained to engage and conduct research across these areas of focus.   As one example, we initiated a three-year effort to assess the ecological health and social significance of a network of high Andean lakes near the city of Loja. Teams of students worked in two sites: a pristine Andean lake system called Tres Lagunas, and in an indigenous Shuar community called El Qiim.  Team members evaluated the impact of introduced non-native trout, measured water quality, and assessed baseline ecological conditions through measures like nutrient concentration and invertebrate diversity and abundance. At the same time, social science students interviewed stakeholders in the communities that rely on Tres Lagunas for water. They found a healthy, largely un-impacted system that was deeply beloved by local stakeholders- but often poorly understood. They also found an area under threat, with projected increases in illegal road development, cattle grazing, fire, artisanal mining and many other processes that could dramatically change the regionÆs character.  Other students worked in similar integrated teams. Research topics ranged from the dietary choices of Andean Bears (the only bear native to South America), to the genetics of the Spectral Bat (the largest carnivorous bat in the world), and the functional structure of a unique local dry forest plant. All of these projects were exploring novel scientific territory because there has been minimal ecological research in the area.  Faculty from UTPL mentored students from UI. These researchers were- in many cases- pursuing PhDs themselves, and these projects will contribute directly to their emergence as top international scientists. A number of important research methodologies were shared between UI and UTPL- ranging from the use of advanced DNA analysis of plants and animals to sophisticated quantifying and analysis of recorded voice interviews. UTPL is striving to become a regional and international leader in tropical biology and conservation, and these projects have been of great benefit to both institutions.  Our project has produced multiple publications and meeting presentations in social and ecological sciences &ndash; all including student researchers.  We anticipate additional publications and ongoing collaboration with Ecuadorian scientists as a result of these research projects.  UI is partnering with UTPL to help them develop and implement what will be the first Ecuadorian masters program in Ecology and Conservation. Using ..."
"The purpose of our project is to digitize (i.e., image and database) botanical research specimens at nearly twenty university, college, and federal agency herbaria in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. Vascular plant, moss, lichen, and fungal specimens will be included in the project. Once digitized, we will place these records online for the public through an existing Web portal (http://www.pnwherbaria.org).  We are leveraging the cyberinfrastructure (e.g., Ethernet, servers, technical staff) available at several large universities to build partnerships with smaller institutions that otherwise would not have the resources to undertake this activity.<br/><br/>Our project provides tangible benefits to the general public, undergraduate students, and the research community.  Digitizing specimens and making them available online creates public access to collections that have been assembled in part through prior federal funding.  The specimen data will be downloadable from the Web site, so anyone can use the information to pursue unique interests and questions.  Undergraduate students will be involved extensively with imaging and data basing activities, providing them with skills and training applicable to future professional pursuits.

The project began in June of 2010, a collaboration between the University of Idaho Stillinger Herbarium and herbaria at the University of Washington, Oregon State University, and Montana State University with the goal of imaging, databasing, and making available online, herbarium specimens from the Pacific Northwest. Our improved website, funded by the grant, currently provides access to over 2.6 million specimen records and 630,000+ high-resolution images from 27 herbaria, making it the most comprehensive source of herbarium specimen data for the Pacific Northwest. Data are available for nearly all of the major herbaria in our region and a growing portion of the herbaria at smaller institutions and agencies, and cover vascular plants, bryophytes (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts), algae, lichens, and fungi.  A redesigned specimen search page (http://www.pnwherbaria.org/data/search.php) contains many features besides basic text searches, including map-based searches, images of specimen sheets, and numerous options for filtering, displaying, and downloading data.  Specimen images are viewable online at full resolution and serve as a new digital reference for the plants of the Pacific Northwest. You can also create checklists for counties in the region or any arbitrary geographic region, and the datasets are portable through mobile-optimized content to allow access to data and images in the field on a smart phone or tablet.  At the University of Idaho Stillinger Herbarium, we have been imaging and databasing our vascular plant collection of ca. 160,000 specimens, as well as several smaller herbaria in the region, including the University of Idaho ExtensionÆs Lambert-Erickson Weed Herbarium.  Currently, we have imaged the entire collection and databased more than 132,000 of those specimens. All of these are immediately accessible through the ConsortiumÆs online data portal.  At this time, the Consortium has acquired images for more over 630,000 vascular plant specimens from more than 12 different herbaria, including many smaller collections, and databased these, plus another 200,000 bryophytes, lichens, and fungi.  Combined with existing data from other contributing herbaria, the total number of specimens accessible through our online portal now exceeds 2.6 million specimens!  Undergraduate students have been involved extensively with imaging and databasing activities &ndash; at the University of Idaho Stillinger Herbarium we have employed more than 30 different students throughout this process &ndash; providing them with skills and training applicable to future professional pursuits.

"This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project is a Type III (A:C) partnership between University of Idaho, an NSF PFI graduate (0090635), and Idaho State University, an institution new to the PFI Program (defined as one that has never been a PFI grantee) seeks to address the lack of modern techniques and protocols to assess physiological health of fish by development, validation, and calibration of a novel and potentially transformational product: the erythrocyte assay system for fish (EASY-F).  This assay system will capitalize on the fact that fish erythrocytes are nucleated and thus have a complete genome to respond to environmental conditions and experimental manipulations. Assessment of the physiological health of fish requires sensitive, accurate tools that can provide rapid assessments and predictive information.<br/><br/>Fish play crucial and multiple roles in human society; they are valued as essential components of the aquatic environment in the U.S.; they are considered biomarkers to assess the health of aquatic ecosystems, and they are important to the sport and recreation industry in the U.S.  What unites the various roles of fish in the environment and human society is that they all depend on production of healthy fish, both in nature and in farms and hatcheries. Testing and development of the proposed EASY-F quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) mini array will have an impact on Native American interests in salmonids directly.  Tribal Groups are co-managers of salmonid fisheries and each tribe operates its own fisheries department.  Successful partnership with tribal stakeholders begins with research collaboration, technology sharing, and data exchange.  Development and validations of the EASY-F system will rely in large part on the direct collaboration of tribal stakeholders.  In turn, the use and commercialization of the EASY-F technology will directly affect tribal interests by providing additional opportunities to train tribal fisheries scientists, raise the level of technological expertise in tribal fisheries departments, and improve information exchange among stakeholders crucial to the co-management of the fisheries.  Ultimately, technology transferred from this project has the potential to influence the management of fish populations affected by disease or other environmental stressors, populations under restoration, and captive populations being enhanced to increase productivity.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are:  Academic Institutions:  University of Idaho (Moscow and Hagerman, ID) (lead institution), Idaho State University (Pocatello, ID), and University of Chile (Santiago de Chile; Private Sector Organizations: Cooke Aquaculture Inc.

This study measured acute and chronic effects of these challenges on gene expression in red blood cells and on other blood parameters. Fish red blood cells are nucleated, in contrast to red blood cells of mammals. Therefore, fish red blood cells contain chromosomes with genes that respond to changes in the body of the fish associated with environmental challenges. Measuring gene expression changes in fish red blood cells could be a novel way of determining if fish are being affected by changes in their environment and if they are being affected, to what extent? The intent of this project was to develop a commercially useful, less-invasive method to assess stress caused by increasingly common environmental changes. Rainbow trout were used as the test fish and over the course of the project, fish were exposed to a number of environmental stressors and gene expression levels in red blood cells were measured. Many genes were examined, and several genes were found to be excellent specific markers for each of the environmental challenges that were used.  A novel system using dialysis casettes to maintain fish blood cells in a healthy state for extended periods was developed in this project. This system allowed fish red blood cells to be exposed to differing conditions, such as elevated water temperature or low dissolved oxygen levels, without having to subject fish to stressful environments. It also allowed the researchers to examine gene expression responses of red blood cells to environmental conditions independently of other factors that normally occur in the body during stress, such as elevated glucose or cortisol levels. The project developed a unique fish rearing system, called the ""Envirotron,"" where a large number of fish tanks can be supplied with water of variable quality, providing the means to conduct comprehensive and replicated studies of the effects of water quality on fish performance and health.  The use of laser-capture technology was another unique aspect of the project that allowed the collection of individual fish blood cells from blood smears to assess gene expression in different types of blood cells.  Genes in red blood cells that were found to be specific markers for different environmental challenges and are appropriate candidates for developing a commercial test (i.e. Easy-F gene panel) were validated and are now ready to use. Significant impacts in other disciplines for the panel of genes identified in this project to assess stress and well-being in red blood cells include water temperature fluctuation due to global warming/climate change, diverse stressors like pollution, transport, handling, disease or vaccination, or dietary changes.   In terms of impacts, measuring gene expression in rainbow trout blood cells exposed to varying water quality offers the prospect of using gene expression values as markers for sensitivity or tolerance to low water quality in commercial fish breeding programs The ultimate goal of such programs is develop lines that are more tolerant of low water quality. The project also contributed to fisheries management, particularly with respect to habitat quality. As such, the project benefits Native Americans (as natural resource co-managers) and state, federal and private entities involved in hatchery production and wild fish management.  Most importantly, the project provided training in molecular genetics, biochemistry, experimental design, fish culture and experimental sampling to a range of students.  Students trained included three high school seniors, seven undergraduate students, three Master of Science students, four doctoral students and two post-doctoral researchers.

There is also increased recognition that forests will produce these products indefinitely if managers maintain the quality of soil in which trees are grown.  Yet while demand is increasing, the productive forest land base is shrinking.  To address this forest product supply and demand conflict, the University of Idaho conducted several projects to improve forest productivity through participation in the NSF Center for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS).  These UIdaho CAFS projects included tree seed orchard protection from pests, isolation and testing of endophytic microbes that are capable of enhancing growth and pathogen resistance, development of genetic markers to aid breeding and selection of superior tree varieties, and management of stand density to enhance forest health and vigor.  Each of these projects had significant outcomes and important impacts.   Seed orchard protection work demonstrated the superiority of the insecticide emamectin benzoate to control cone beetle and cone worm in Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine.  Based on these results, industry partners are operationally applying systemic insecticides to control seed orchard pests in areas where broadcast insecticide applications may not be efficient or desirable  A better understanding of western conifer seed bug feeding habits and reproductive success could provide insight for developing additional control measures of this common yet difficult to monitor seed orchard pest. We found that adult females oviposited more frequently on ponderosa pine, and nymphs survived longest and were most likely to complete development on lodgepole pine than on other conifers hosts.  This information then allows us to focus control on pine species.   Modifying microbial communities through inoculations of select endophytes can provide control for pathogens.  We found that inoculation of ponderosa pine needles with endophytic fungi modifies the disease severity of red-banded needle blight, both positively and negatively depending on the endophyte used.  We found that inoculating seedlings with naturally occurring conifer root endophytes reduces seedling mortality from nursery pathogens. Other forest root endophytes reduce fecundity of Fusarium species, which are severe pathogens in forest nurseries.  Incorporation of forest endophytes into conifers nursery production of seedlings for reforestation and plantation establishment may increase out-planting survival and reduce fungicide use.   To develop genetic markers to aid breeding and selection for western white pine, we tested markers on samples from the Bingham Seed Orchard and found over 50 markers to be useful.  We then conducted simulation studies to estimate the number of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers needed to differentiate offspring with common parentage.  The simulation showed that the high degree of relatedness of trees at Bingham would require about 200 SNPs to ensure a high degree of accuracy of parental reconstruction. With costs of SNP genotyping continuing to decline and because of previous success with Douglas fir using modern sequencing techniques, we decided to broaden the scope to develop 20,000 SNP markers for genomic selection in both Douglas-fir and Western white pine. Once developed during Phase II of CAFS, these markers will provide a broad platform for future studies aimed at examining the relationships between important traits and specific SNP markers.   To enhance forest health and vigor through stand density management, we are monitoring both thinned plots and plots reserved from thinning at over 60 locations throughout the Inland Northwest.  Of those, we selected 14 locations to represent the range in productivity and initial stand density.  We found that thinning increased light availability by 400%, i..."
"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). <br/>Quantifying the Effects of Large-Scale Vegetation Change on Coupled Water, Carbon and Nutrient Cycles: Beetle Kill in Western Montane Forest<br/>We are quantifying how rapid, extensive changes in forest structure and composition associated with Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB) infestation of western montane forests affect the coupling of water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles. MPB infestation and associated fungal pathogens radically change ecosystem structure by killing host trees, altering surface energy and water partitioning, reducing carbon uptake, and putting organic matter into soil on short and long time scales. The widespread extent of this disturbance presents a major challenge for governments and resource managers who must respond to the changes, yet lack a predictive understanding of how these systems will respond to the disturbance over various temporal and spatial scales. This disturbance allows us to test emerging theories of direct and indirect effects of vegetation change on coupled biogeochemical cycles following a disturbance that initially changes only the amount of living biomass while leaving soil hydrologic and chemical characteristics unchanged. By working at sites with different levels of MPB impact, we are evaluating how the dramatic loss of tree function both directly (i.e. transpiration and carbon fixation) and indirectly (i.e. snow capture, redistribution, and surface energy balance) affects water, carbon and nitrogen cycling. <br/><br/>Our work is organized around two, broad questions that require both an interdisciplinary approach and close integration of observation and modeling. How do changes in vegetation structure associated with MPB alter the partitioning of energy and water? And How do these changes in energy and water availability affect local to regional scale biogeochemical cycles? We have assembled a diverse team of biogeochemists, ecologists, hydrologists, and atmospheric scientists to address these questions using measurements, modeling tools, and conceptual approaches from each discipline.  Our approach includes intensive, coordinated hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological observations designed to quantify the internal coupling of water, carbon, and nutrient cycling, as well as how these processes are expressed in both land surface-atmosphere exchanges and catchment solute export.  These observations are closely integrated with two process models, one from the landsurface community and one from the catchment community, to evaluate our current understanding of how vegetation change alters coupled cycles. To extend our work beyond the relatively short time-scale of our observations, we coordinate with several ongoing projects, including the Boulder Creek CZO and the Niwot Ridge LTER.<br/><br/>By quantifying both the biological and physical controls that forest vegetation has on water and biogeochemical cycles, our project will both improve our basic understand of the coupling between water, energy, carbon, and nitrogen.  Through coordination with land surface and catchment modeling communities we will incorporate this knowledge into the broader community. Our educational activities build on successful efforts at all institutions, while coordination with land and water resource managers will ensure our knowledge is transferred to the applied science community.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.082,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,138986.00,138986,4900,Hydrologic Sciences,0910928,,Jeffrey A Hicke,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,jhicke@uidaho.edu,Jeffrey,Hicke,,Thomas Torgersen,,['01R00910DB RRA RECOVERY ACT'],09/18/2009,10/01/2009,09/30/2012,"ETBC: Collaborative Research: Quantifying the Effects of Large-Scale Vegetation Change on Coupled Water, Carbon, and Nutrient Cycles: Beetle Kill in Western Montane Forests",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,A,"['Remote Sensing of Environment~2011~115~Meddens, A.

"This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award supports an interdisciplinary, international graduate research and education program on resilience of ecological and social systems in fragmented landscapes that are subject to human-induced and natural change. The program is being implemented jointly by the University of Idaho and the Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center (CATIE), in Costa Rica. The aim of the program is to offer doctoral students the skills necessary to work in interdisciplinary teams that address research questions relevant to the social, political, economic, biological, and physical factors that influence change in ecological and social systems, and to manage the ecological and social challenges arising from such change. Students in the program work in interdisciplinary teams in six geographic regions in Idaho and Costa Rica characterized by human-induced landscape change. These regions illustrate conditions worldwide. The program builds upon the expertise of numerous educators and researchers in diverse disciplines at the University of Idaho and CATIE. It offers a unique graduate experience that includes faculty mentors and course work at two institutions, interdisciplinary student teams that address similar research questions in temperate and tropical ecosystems, jointly-authored publications, and professional development activities including international research experience, annual meetings, interaction with stakeholders, and interdisciplinary training workshops. The program will advance theory and develop new methods and tools for interdisciplinary education, and broaden participation from underrepresented groups.

The educational model involves: 1) identification of integrated research questions combining team members? disciplines; 2) course work to review theoretical underpinnings of interdisciplinarity and develop integrated research proposals to address the questions; 3) meetings and workshops to enhance team cohesiveness; 4) engagement with stakeholders; and 5) interdisciplinary team research that yields joint dissertation chapters and publications. The UI-CATIE educational model was grounded in the inter- and transdisciplinary literature and faculty perspectives, and was improved based on successes and challenges experienced by participating students and faculty.   The educational model prepared students for interdisciplinary, collaborative team-based research to address problem-based questions by engaging stakeholders. It helped create individuals with shield-shape competency with the understanding and training necessary to work in a team environment to address complex interdisciplinary problems. This resulted in a high level of integration among students. Students were exposed to theoretical and empirical literature on disciplinary and interdisciplinary research, and contributed to this growing literature as part of their doctoral education. Graduates from the project assert the interdisciplinary experience and professional development opportunities provided by the educational model were instrumental in their ability to secure and succeed in their current positions.  Many are currently engaged in interdisciplinary research and education projects.  Of the 23 students enrolled in the project, 20 have completed their doctoral degrees, 2 are scheduled to graduate in December 2016, and one left the program. Seven of the students are female and six are Hispanic or Native American. Five of the graduates currently hold academic positions. All teams developed interdisciplinary dissertation chapters/papers. Seven interdisciplinary papers have been published, several others have been submitted or are being developed. Students and faculty made over 80 disciplinary and 70 interdisciplinary presentations at meetings and over 60 presentations to stakeholders.  The program retained students at a very high rate. The graduation rate for the project (87%) surpasses graduation rat es for comparable doctoral programs in the U.S. (54%). Similar to other IGERT projects students completed their degrees within times comparable to other doctoral students or sooner. These figures indicate that the educational model enhanced the ability to retain and graduate students in a timely fashion. This success in retention and graduation was a function of many project elements, including the rigorous trainee identification and recruitment process, the strong sense of belonging created by the project, and the team-based nature of the graduate experience that is the hallmark of the educational model. Based on the experiences and perspectives of project participants the educational model fulfilled the call to better prepare future scientists to address complex problems.

Bacteria can store different forms of organic carbon (in this case they were fed principally acetic acid, which is the primary ingredient in vinegar) inside their cell. The so-called PHA represents a carbon and energy storage reserve for bacteria. However, when recovered from the bacterial cell the intracellular granules are a form of thermoplastic (not unlike polypropylene or polyethylene). Our interest lies in ultimately commercially producing PHA using wild bacteria fed acetic acid produced from fermenting organic rich waste.  In this project we completed the following:  - We isolated and cultured bacteria capable of PHA synthesis from a mixed microbial consortium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time anyone has accomplished this task.  - We identified the isolated bacterium as Acinetobacter spp., which are known PHA producers.  - We confirmed the presence of intracellular PHA granules visually using fluorescent microscopy.  - Analysis of the Acinetobacter isolate confirmed PHA synthesis, with a maximum intracellular PHA concentration of 43% (w/w).  Distinct differences in protein abundance were observed over the course of PHA synthesis compared to the PHA degradation. Higher molecular weight proteins were observed in the later stages of the feast period. Multiple protein signals were observed in the non-cytoplasmic fraction of the lysates, which may represent important membrane-bound proteins and possibly a class of proteins known as phasins, which are key regulators in PHA synthesis.  - Proteins were recovered from PHA granules for analysis. Proteins were detected with molecular weights ranging from 11 kDa to 45 kDa (identification of these proteins is pending).  The research funding was used to support a PhD student in biochemistry as well as a number of undergraduate students in civil engineering. The graduate student and undergraduate students, along with the PI, gained valuable experience in performing proteomic studies on mixed microbial consortia cultured in complex wastewater environments. Very little research has been conducted to apply advanced molecular techniques on undefined microbial consortia being utilized for biotechnological purposes.  Furthermore, minimal research has  been conducted on the PHA synthesis meta-metabolism (to the best of our knowledge we are the only research team in the U.S. conducting such research - we have networked with researchers in Portugal, Netherlands, and Italy who have conducted similar work), and the protocols were originally developed for use in pure cultures. Thus, we have had to overcome many challenges in successfully applying these advanced molecular techniques on such complex matrices. Our preliminary results are very encouraging.  Historically environmental engineers have studied microbiome systems principally as a ""black box,"" extracting gross process performance parameters based on extrapolations of bulk solution process indicators. While such an approach has been very successful, for all intents and purposes we have fully mined that approach. The research conducted on this project takes the next big leap to apply advanced molecular techniques on complex bacterial microbiomes for the purposes of enhancing a fundamental understanding on structure/function related to a specific biotechnological process (PHA production). The research is broadly contributing to both the molecular/microbiology and environmental engineering disciplines. To date such interdisciplinary approaches have only been very minimally applied, largely due to the intrinsic complexities and challenges associated  with applying pure-culture based techniques to highly complex systems. However, the interdisciplinary approach has great potential to yield significant advan..."
"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Chemistry Department at The University of Idaho will acquire a femtosecond mid-IR spectrometer. The instrument will have core components that are common in many types of ultrafast spectroscopic measurements. It will implement design features that will ease the transition between different experimental configurations, so that a wide array of experiments can be accommodated. Initially, the PIs are planning four very different experiments. Fast events in RNA folding will be studied using coherent two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D-IR).  2D-IR will also be used to distinguish equilibrium from resonance structures in homoaromatic molecules. The instrument will be used to characterize the migration of mid-IR photons by scattering media. The ultrafast IR transient absorption spectroscopy of nitrosyl compounds subsequent to laser photolysis will also be investigated. <br/><br/>A femtosecond mid-IR spectrometer is an ultra fast spectrometer that operates in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Advances in ultrafast laser technology have made the use of sub-100 femtosecond laser pulses more routine.  As the field continues to grow, the significance of molecular phenomena on time scales of picoseconds and shorter is being realized. Arguably, some of the most fundamental processes in chemistry (e.g., bond breaking and formation, electron transfer, and others) occur on ultrafast time scales.   This acquisition will exploit the extreme versatility of the instrument in the growing field of ultrafast spectroscopy.  The instrument is part of a program to develop a strong ultrafast spectroscopic capability to stimulate a number of research programs as well as to provide a base for collaborations with colleagues at national labs and universities in the Northwest.   A number of collaborations with researchers from around the Northwest who are interested in using the instrument have been initiated.  As an educational institution, all aspects of the work will be performed by graduate students, select undergraduates, and postdocs as part of their academic experience.  This will provide a rich training experience in the growing field of ultrafast methodology.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.082,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,710000.00,710000,4900,Major Research Instrumentation,0923583,,Eric B Brauns,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,ebrauns@uidaho.edu,Eric,Brauns,,Carlos Murillo,,['01R00910DB RRA RECOVERY ACT'],07/29/2009,08/01/2009,07/31/2013,MRI: Acquisition of a Femtosecond Mid-Infrared Spectrometer,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Peter R Griffiths', 'Richard V Williams', 'Thomas E Bitterwolf']",B,,
"0854522 / 0854553 <br/>McNamara / Goodwin <br/><br/>The altered spatiotemporal distribution of winter snowpack is perhaps the single greatest ongoing and future climatic impact in the western United States. The planned WATERS network must be designed to address the present and potential hydrological impacts of this disturbance. This proposed WATERS testbed project aims to address the hydrologic impacts of changing snowpack regime in western mountains using the Middle Snake Hydrologic Observatory, formed by partnering the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) with the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed (DCEW) on opposite sides of the Snake River Plain near Boise, Idaho. The premise of this proposal is that understanding the hydrologic impacts of climate change in the semi-arid mountains of the western US requires understanding the relationships between snow distribution, landscape properties, and soil moisture dynamics. Their central question is: How will earlier snowmelt and upward migration of the rain/snow transition zone affect spring soil drydown patterns in complex terrain? They will evaluate this question using a space for time substitution approach. Specifically, they propose that future impacts of climate-induced changes in snowpack spatiotemporal distribution on soil moisture dynamics can be deduced by evaluating current differences across elevation gradients. The key question will be addressed with three specific objectives, with an additional objective to synthesize and integrate the project with community research: 1) determine the physiologic and climatic controls on the spatial and temporal distribution of snow and the rain/snow transition; 2) determine the hillslope-scale linkages between snow and soil moisture dynamics across elevation gradients; 3) develop a coupled snowmelt/soil moisture dynamics model to test theories against observations; and 4) coordinate and synthesize community research in the MSHO. <br/><br/>They contend that hydrologic observatory networks will be challenged with leveraging funding sources and providing value-added resources to projects led by externally funded scientists. They suggest that observatory networks must be designed to facilitate community science by providing long-term baseline hydrologic information coupled with focused measurements designed for maximum benefit of teams working on integrated research topics, and providing resources to teams of experts that will add value with leveraged funding for specific projects. The RCEW and the DCEW, are ideally suited to demonstrate this community science concept. Both sites have core ongoing hydrometeorological observations along elevation gradients, and both host numerous externally funded projects related the proposed key question. The PIs will address each objective above by capitalizing on core measurements, leveraging existing funded projects, and adding new measurements with this project. By integrating and supplementing studies along elevation gradients, they will demonstrate how hydrologic observatories can be used to facilitate community science efforts to address this critical water resource problem. <br/><br/>The proposed project is closely based on many concepts outlined in Science, Education, and Design Strategy for the WATer and Environmental Research Systems Network, known as the SEDS document. The proposed experiments and observations on the changing snowpack are designed according to the gradient concept outlined in the SEDS document in a set of clusters and catchments. The changing snowpack has been identified as a key hydrologic problem in nearly all documents published by WATERS, CLEANER, and CUAHSI. The proposed project follows the WATERS Network conceptual design principles by integrating multiple observatories (RCEW and DCEW), using CUAHSI cyberinfrastructure, applying new sensor technology, integrating new modeling strategies with observations, building collaboration between universities and federal agencies, and implementing education and outreach programs. In addition to testing and demonstrating WATERS concepts, this project will contribute to a greater understanding of climate change impacts in the western United States.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,214380.00,214380,4900,Nanoscale Interactions Program,0854553,,Timothy E Link,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,pgoodwin@uidaho.edu,Peter,Goodwin,nosavage@nsf.gov,Nora Savage,7032927949,['01000910DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/17/2009,08/01/2009,07/31/2014,Collaborative Research: A WATERS testbed to investigate the impacts of changing snow conditions on hydrologic processes in the western United States,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Peter Goodwin', 'Daneil Marks']",E,"['HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES~2009~23~Pomeroy, JW; Marks, D; Link, T; Ellis, C; Hardy, J; Rowlands, A; Granger, R~10.1002/hyp.732~2513~2525~~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=183064384#000269103200010~The impact of coniferous forest temperature on incoming longwave radiation to melting snow~Y~~~~~~', 'Water Resources Research~2010~~Nayak, A., D.

"Coevolution is a relationship of reciprocal natural selection and evolutionary change between two species, such as predator and prey, host and parasite, or plant and pollinator. Biologists have long believed that coevolution has helped create much of the diversity of life on Earth, but the evidence for such a connection is only indirect. This project will directly test the hypothesis that coevolution between Joshua tree and its pollinator moths has caused these tightly interacting species to diverge together.  Joshua trees are pollinated by two different species of yucca moths, each occurring in a separate part of the host plant's range; and Joshua trees pollinated by different moth species themselves differ in key floral traits. To determine whether these parallel differences are due to coevolution, the investigators will make use of the only population of Joshua trees in which both tree types and both pollinator species are commingled. The investigators will use genetic markers to reconstruct family relationships between Joshua trees at this site, an approach very similar to paternity testing in humans. They will then use these reconstructed relationships to estimate the degree to which Joshua tree traits are heritable, that is, how much a tree resembles its parents. If Joshua tree traits involved in the interaction with yucca moths show greater heritable differences between the two tree types than traits unconnected to the interaction, then it is likely that coevolution between Joshua tree and its pollinators is responsible for those differences.<br/><br/>The project will involve four undergraduate volunteer assistants, including underrepresented groups. Data will be shared with scientific staff at Mojave National Preserve (MNP) and Joshua Tree National Park (JTNP), which together contain the majority of protected Joshua tree populations.  Information concerning Joshua tree's interactions with its pollinators and the genetic diversity and structure of Joshua tree populations are critical for conservation of this flagship species, which is under increasing threat from anthropogenic range fragmentation and global climate change.

"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>The PIs will study higher secant varieties of classically studied varieties such as Segre varieties, Grassmann varieties, and Segre-Veronese varieties. These varieties correspond to parameter spaces for rank one tensors, alternating tensors, and hybrids of regular tensors and symmetric tensors, and their (closed) higher secant varieties correspond to compactifications of the parameter spaces for higher rank tensors. The main goal of the research is the classification of defective secant varieties of Segre varieties, Grassmann varieties and Segre-Veronese varieties. This is analogous to the celebrated theorem of Alexander and Hirschowitz, which asserts that higher secant varieties of Veronese varieties have the expected dimension (modulo a fully described list of exceptions). This work completed the Waring problem for polynomials which had stood for some time as an outstanding unsolved problem. There is a corresponding, conjectural complete list of defective secant varieties for Segre varieties and for Grassmann varieties. The first component of the project is on the refinement of existing methods and the development of new theoretical and algorithmic methods towards the solution of this classification problem. The second component of the project is concerned with decomposition of tensors.<br/><br/>In many applications, it is natural to represent a collection of data as a multi-indexed list. Alternatively, one can think of the data as a multidimensional array (sometimes called a multi-way array). For example, a digital grayscale picture can be stored as a matrix of numbers where each pixel location in the picture corresponds to a location in the matrix and the number in the matrix corresponds to the darkness of the pixel. In a similar manner, a digital color picture can be stored as a three dimensional array of numbers. A mathematical framework that includes the study of multi-way arrays, and their representations as sums of more basic objects, is through parameter spaces of tensors. This project explores problems related to tensors, tensor decomposition, tensor rank and tensor border rank from an algebro-geometric point viewpoint. These subjects have significant applications in fields as diverse as signal processing, data analysis, computational biology, combinatorics, algebraic geometry and statistics. It is the expectation, therefore, that techniques developed through this research will advance our knowledge and understanding across multiple disciplines.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.082,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,112000.00,112000,4900,"ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM",0901816,,Hirotachi Abo,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,abo@uidaho.edu,Hirotachi,Abo,tluo@nsf.gov,Tie Luo,7032928448,['01R00910DB RRA RECOVERY ACT'],06/29/2009,07/01/2009,06/30/2013,Collaborative Research: Algebraic Geometry of Tensors,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,"['JOURNAL OF SYMBOLIC COMPUTATION~2010~45~Abo, H~10.1016/j.jsc.2010.06.00~1254~1269~~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=193036377#000284136300002~On non-defectivity of certain Segre-Veronese varieties~Y~~~~~~', 'JOURNAL OF SYMBOLIC COMPUTATION~2011~46~Di Rocco, S; Eklund, D; Peterson, C; Sommese, AJ~10.1016/j.jsc.2010.06.02~23~33~~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=193209271#000284391300002~Chern numbers of smooth varieties via homotopy continuation and intersection theory~Y~~~~~~', 'JOURNAL OF ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY~2012~21~Abo, H; Ottaviani, G; Peterson, C~~1~20~~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=203425431#000298778400001~NON-DEFECTIVITY OF GRASSMANNIANS OF PLANES~Y~~~~~~', ""Linear Algebra and its Applications~2013~439~HIrotachi Abo, Jia Wan~~2330~~~~On Waring's problem for systems of skew symmetric forms~~~~~~~"", 'Annali di Matematica Pura ed Applicata.

" In mountainous drainage basins, steep channels (gradients of 3-20%) occupy the majority of the total channel length and influence the downstream delivery of sediment and water to metropolitan areas and hydropower facilities.  The volume and grain sizes of sediment supplied from these streams also impact the success of downstream river restoration projects.  Basin-scale sediment transport predictions are needed in restoration design to account for the effect of sediment supply on aquatic habitat, water quality, and channel stability. Most sediment transport equations are based on empirical fits to data measured at the reach-scale, do not include the mechanics of grain motion, and were developed for lower-gradient channels.  It is hypothesized that bedload transport equations for steep, rough streams need to include: 1) the range of turbulence and grain properties that control the initiation of grain motion, 2) the spatial variability in stresses and bedload transport rates on patches, and 3) the effect of temporal and spatial variations in sediment supply.  Flume experiments will be used to test this hypothesis, further elucidate the interaction between turbulence and bedload transport, and inform theoretical and empirical models that predict sediment flux at the reach scale.  Such models will be tested in local and international field locations and will transform predictions of landscape evolution and river restoration design by providing accurate and mechanistic estimates of sediment flux in steep streams.  The intellectual merit of this research is a fundamental and predictive understanding of the processes that control turbulence and sediment transport in steep streams. The framework of sediment transport and river restoration will be used to educate graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students on the importance of water resources and functioning stream ecosystems. Four education objectives are proposed: 1) a series of graduate student classes that develop critical thinking, scientific writing, and interdisciplinary team skills, 2) international research experience for undergraduate and graduate students, 3) programs to educate K-12 students on river processes, and 4) a new Women in Science Camp that encourages young women to enter careers in math, science, and engineering.  <br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,455000.00,455000,4900,EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES,0847799,,Elowyn Yager,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,eyager@uidaho.edu,Elowyn,Yager,,Thomas Torgersen,,"['01000910DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001011DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001112DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001213DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001314DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",06/01/2009,06/01/2009,05/31/2016,CAREER:  A mechanistic understanding of sediment transport in mountain streams with applications in river restoration and science education,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,"['GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS~2012~39~Yager, E.

We demonstrated that sediment transport equations for steep, rough streams need to include: 1) the turbulence and grain properties that control the initiation of grain motion, 2) the spatial variability in shear stresses and bed grain sizes, and 3) the effect of temporal variations in upstream sediment supply. We used laboratory flume experiments, field measurements and numerical models to elucidate the mechanics of sediment transport, and develop equations that predict sediment flux. Our equations significantly improved sediment flux predictions in steep streams. Improvements in such predictions could result in more accurate estimates of channel stability, and river restoration and infrastructure (e.g. dam filling capacity, culvert diameter) design.  We also significantly advanced the understanding of the mechanics of sediment transport including novel insights into the role of turbulence, grain to grain interactions, and sediment supply on the onset of particle motion and sediment fluxes. We improved research infrastructure though the installation of instrumentation to measure sediment transport; few locations around the world contain such equipment.   The framework of sediment transport and river restoration was used to educate graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students and teachers on water resources. Four education activities were conducted: 1) a series of graduate student classes that fostered critical thinking, scientific writing, and interdisciplinary skills, 2) international research experience for undergraduate and graduate students, 3) programs to educate K-12 students and teachers on river processes, and 4) a Women Outdoors with Science Camp that encouraged young women to enter careers in math, science, and engineering.

"The goal of the University of Idaho GK-12 program is to improve graduate Fellow communication, teaching, collaboration, and teamwork skills, while increasing inquiry-based science taught in rural middle and high schools in Idaho and Washington. Graduate Fellows will be from interdisciplinary degree programs: Waters of the West - Water Resources, Environmental Science, and Environmental Engineering. The STEM theme will be water resources and the environment as a context for learning physical, Earth, and life sciences. The theme and interdisciplinary approach will raise working knowledge of water resources, one of the most compelling and complex topics facing the world today. Fellows will use their research to convey scientific concepts to students, linking the science content to local water resource issues (e.g. aquifer depletion, floods and droughts, or the inter-relationship of salmon, hydropower dams, and Indian Tribes) that are relevant to the teachers, students, and community.<br/><br/>The program will serve seven rural school districts, including the Lapwai (Nez Perce Tribe) district, which is 82% Native American; all schools are within river basins subjected to integrated analysis by the Waters of the West program. Five specific impacts are: (a) Fellows will effectively communicate scientific concepts in classroom and public contexts, (b) Fellows will successfully apply collaboration and teamwork skills in teaching and research (c) Fellows will demonstrate inquiry-based teaching skills, (c) STEM teachers will demonstrate increased content knowledge, mentoring skills, and confidence and competence in inquiry-based teaching, and (e) grade 7-12 students will demonstrate increased scientific knowledge, excitement, confidence and career awareness.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.076,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,2941030.00,2941030,4900,GRAD TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12,0841199,,Jan Boll,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,barbwill@uidaho.edu,Barbara,Williams,,Laura Regassa,,"['01000910DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '04001011DB NSF Education & Human Resource', '04001112DB NSF Education & Human Resource', '04001213DB NSF Education & Human Resource']",04/17/2009,05/01/2009,05/31/2015,"New, GK-12 Project in Water Resources for Middle and High Schools in Rural Northern Idaho and Eastern Washington",Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Jerine Pegg', 'Paul Allan']",C,,"From 2009 &ndash; 2015, the Waters of the West (WoW) Program at the University of Idaho (UI) successfully implemented a Graduate STEM Fellows in K-12 Education (GK-12) grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The title of the grant was ""New, GK-12 Project in Water Resources for Middle and High Schools in Rural Northern Idaho and Eastern Washington."" Through this grant, graduate fellows in the WoW program were funded to teach science in middle and high school classrooms for one year. These graduate fellows received training in teaching and science communication skills. They were then challenged to work collaboratively with a classroom teacher to develop unique, hands-on, inquiry-based lessons that tied into course curriculum. They also were encouraged to teach students about their own research and other applicable current research.  Through the WoW GK-12 program, three groups of program participants benefited. Graduate fellows learned to effectively communicate scientific concepts in a variety of contexts, apply collaboration and teamwork skills in teaching and research settings, and demonstrate general and inquiry-based teaching skills. STEM teachers gained content knowledge, mentoring skills, and confidence and competence in inquiry-based teaching. Grade 7-12 students increased scientific knowledge, excitement, confidence and career awareness.  Over the course of the award period, 46 graduate fellows participated in the program, each spending 6-10 hours per week in the classroom in addition to preparation time outside of class. Twenty-seven 7th-12th grade STEM teachers from 17 different secondary schools participated in the GK-12 program, and over 2,000 7th-12th grade students benefitted from the presence of a graduate fellow in their classrooms.  NSF has a goal that all GK-12 programs will have a lasting impact and systemic change within the university in which they are working. Therefore, during the final years of our program, in addition to achieving GK-12 goals, we developed, trial tested, and acquired additional funding for a program that would carry forward the goals of the GK-12 program. This sustainability effort is called The Confluence Project (TCP) and shares the same goals as the original GK-12 program by partnering graduate students with high school science teachers to deliver inquiry-based science education to high school students. TCP also brings place-based, project-based education to the classes it works with. High school students learn science by going into the field to conduct research with graduate students and other local experts. Thus far, this program has been well-received by teachers, students and school administrators. In order to continue this program into the future with potentially limited funding, graduate students will receive training and focus their efforts on leading field experiences and mentoring students to do research projects. We have found that through those tasks, graduate students greatly improve their science communication, teamwork and teaching skills. At the same time, teachers have become more excited about their curriculum and day-to-day instruction while high school students learn research and critical thinking skills while getting to know their local environment.

"42 (Geology) <br/>Six pairs of computer animations and visualization tools for use in teaching physical geology and mineralogy are being developed. The first half of each animation pair is suitable for use in geoscience classrooms. Instructors show these animations while providing cues to aid in students' analysis of the visual information. The second half of each animation pair consists of an on-line interactive web-based exercise suitable for homework or distance-based learning assignments. The style and content of the animations are consistent throughout so that conventions, symbols, and spatial relations carry over from one animation to the next, improving the benefits to student learning. The animations are hosted on a web site dedicated to scaffolding effective practice for teaching with animations, and include not only the animations themselves, but also resources on best practice for use of animations, information on specific learning challenges in teaching geology and mineralogy, and tools for evaluating the use of animations. The animations are being initially tested by a small group of local users for formative evaluation. After revisions, the improved animations will then be embedded in a rich web site that will provide examples of the relationships between content and context for student learning through animations.

This RII project aims to fill a critical niche in hydrology by understanding the nexus between surface flow and groundwater; supporting field studies on a highly managed river system and a relatively unmanaged system; and developing a more complete understanding of how climate change will impact the Western U.S. across multiple watersheds. To do this, capacity will be developed in three areas: 1) hydroclimatology to improve modeling of water resources affected by climate change; 2) integration of hydrology and economic modeling of water resources in the Snake River basin (highly managed river system); and 3) integration of hydrology and ecological change in the Salmon River basin (unmanaged river system). Battelle?s comprehensive analysis of Idaho?s core competencies identified ecological health as an area with high potential for tying its academic research strengths to commercial applications. The research theme of this award directly supports the Ecological Health Technology Platform.<br/><br/>Project Major Foci: The core research focus is the impact of climate change on human and ecologic systems at small to intermediate-sized watersheds. During the first three years of the award, the project will concentrate on hydrologic modeling of the Snake and Salmon basins. Output from the models will be used in the later years of the project to determine the effects of climate change on resources in Idaho. Probabilistic techniques, such as Bayesian network modeling, will be used to derive probability distributions for water supply options and reliability under various scenarios. Results from all studies will be used to populate a web-based decision support system that integrates internet-mapping technologies with Bayesian networks to quantify the impact of climate change on water supply and demand.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The Intellectual Merit lies in the creation of a cohesive team of researchers in climate change and water resources, who will perform modeling of surface and groundwater connections in managed river systems; will enhance the understanding of how climate change impacts may be buffered through effective utilization of groundwater; and will provide key data to clarify economic ramifications of climate change.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The understanding of the effects of climate change on water resources could enhance planning regarding water resources in Idaho as well as the western region of the U. S. <br/>A range of experimental learning programs for secondary students and teachers, designed to enhance STEM education in the state, particularly the Native American and Hispanic populations, will bring the excitement of science to the classrooms.

This statewide project contributed to a strategic area of research in Idaho that has major significance for the stateÆs future prosperity.  The EPSCoR project supported complementary research on a highly managed river system (Snake River Basin) compared to a relatively unmanaged system (Salmon River Basin). By working together across the state and with others, the project expanded data collection, sharing, and analysis capabilities through instrumentation (such as environmental monitoring towers, other field equipment, and experimental facilities) and high-end computing and data management. It has resulted in: a better understanding of coupling between hydrology, ecology, and economics and policies; improved modeling of surface and groundwater; identification of long-term signals of ecological change in pristine river systems; techniques for collection and management of various data types from multiple disciplines, and knowledge about economic ramifications of increased climate variability.    The RII project resulted in the addition of eleven new research-active professors to Idaho to help create a critical mass of expertise related to Water Resources in a Changing Climate. These scientists and engineers and EPSCoR-supported research teams bridged gaps between academic disciplines, fostered collaborative research, and made key contributions to new and existing regional research initiatives that are helping the U.S. to better manage land and water resources, including the USGS Pacific Northwest Climate Science Center, USDA Regional Approaches to Climate Change program, the Northwest Knowledge Network, the Hydrologic Information Systems, the Idaho LiDAR Consortium, a Western Tri-State Consortium of Idaho, Nevada, and New Mexico, and other national Environmental Observatories.  EPSCoR investments resulted in a significant increase in the impact of IdahoÆs research on the national scientific community. The number of RII-related scholarly publications doubled during the award and the rate at which others are citing the scholarly work of Idaho scientists in this project increased significantly. Idaho research data, including finer-scale climate projections and evapotranspiration data, have contributed to improving the usefulness of tools like Google Earth Engine, available to the public and research community worldwide. The RII also contributed to the development of education capacity, ranging from K-12 (promoted by the Idaho STEM Pipeline) to a new doctoral program in Geosciences at Idaho State University. This also has resulted in new, free tools and techniques to analyze the remote sensing data so commonly used by scientists and land managers alike.  In addition, more than 480 people, primarily faculty, students, and technical staff at IdahoÆs universities and colleges gained expertise and research training. Water Resources in a Changing Climate research data and topics were incorporated into K-12 and community outreach activities to achieve broader impacts, and land managers benefited from regular interactions with researchers and access to new research data. The RII provided exceptional undergraduate, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellow research training through research experiences and mentoring, strengthening their preparation for careers in science. It also doubled the participation of underrepresented minority students in EPSCoR and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) activities. More than 1,400 junior high and high school student and 300 teachers received direct training through completely new Junior and Senior High programs at the McCall Outdoor Science School, a highly successful engineerin..."
"Earth is in the midst of a global biodiversity crisis.  Species are disappearing at alarming rates.  The causes of these extinctions are complex, but emerging diseases play an important role, particularly for amphibians.  Ten years ago a new disease caused by a deadly fungus was discovered in frogs.  This chytrid fungus has now infected hundreds of species all around the world.  Despite intensive research efforts, little is still known about how chytrid kills frogs.  This project will use new genomic based techniques to study chytrid.  Whole genome sequences (the complete genetic information encoded in chytrid DNA) will be obtained for chytrid strains from different parts of the world and from different environmental conditions.  This work will help elucidate why certain strains of chytrid are more deadly than others and will help identify particular genes that are important for chytrid's ability to attack frogs.  This project takes a cutting-edge approach to an important disease problem and will benefit conservation efforts in frogs. Results from this research may also provide more general clues about the genetics of fungal pathogens, such as those affecting humans.  From an educational standpoint the findings from this research can be used as a teaching tool to show how creative approaches to environmental problems can have a positive impact on global biodiversity.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,50000.00,50000,4900,Symbiosis Infection & Immunity,0825355,,Erica B Rosenblum,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,rosenblum@berkeley.edu,Erica,Rosenblum,,Mary Beth Saffo,,['01000809DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],06/03/2008,09/01/2008,08/31/2010,Ecological Genomics of a Global Amphibian Pathogen,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,B,"['Diseases of Aquatic Organisms~2009~~Rosenblum, E.B., M.C.

"Many pressing problems are complex in that they require to be addressed in a cross-disciplinary manner. An emerging literature on the challenges of cross disciplinary research emphasizes the critical importance of effective communication. How this is to be achieved is less well understood. In this project, an explicitly philosophical approach is adopted to develop the intellectual common ground that is requisite for effective communication in cross disciplinary collaborations. The need for a philosophical approach stems from the disparate views about the nature of objects studied (metaphysics) and methods of knowing them (epistemology) favored by different disciplines. The premise of this proposal is that a carefully structured process of identifying, understanding, and incorporating philosophical dimensions will serve to facilitate effective communication between cross disciplinary research team members. <br/><br/>The approach to be taken here is to use a set of questions?the ?toolbox??that probes the epistemological and metaphysical aspects of scientific research. In a workshop setting, CDR participants examine these questions as individuals and share their views within their team. The proposed project will extend and improve the toolbox-based method through several distinct activities involving cross disciplinary research including the development of a description of the diversity of existing research collaborations for which the method can be effective, an analysis of knowledge construction and communication in predominant types of research teams, and an adaptation of the toolbox method for greatest effectiveness in these teams. It will also include a test of the revised toolbox with working teams, the use these test sessions to study communication processes and dynamics within this type of research, and the dissemination of the findings of this project to the community of cross disciplinary research practitioners and students through publications, a conference, and an edited volume.<br/><br/>The project will improve the practice of cross disciplinary research in diverse types of collaboration. Its impacts will therefore be felt across the range of activities in which such research is required. Some of these areas of collaborative research are critical for guiding policies aimed to improve human wellbeing, such as those concerning sustainable natural systems and complex public health issues. Others are part of expanding interdisciplinary research at the forefront of discovery, such as computational biology, neurosciences, and nanotechnology. In addition, the project aims to advance epistemology and the philosophy of science by incorporating insights from scientists engaged in cross disciplinary research?philosophy, therefore, is not merely a resource for this project but a direct beneficiary of it. It will also promote teaching, training, and learning by improving the sophistication and skills of graduate students directly involved as workshop participants and those who work as research collaborators.

"The project is strategically awarding S-STEM scholarships to bridge the gap at a pivotal point in postsecondary education: the transition from undergraduate to graduate studies. The intent is three-fold: the first is to retain undergraduates to baccalaureate degree completion by awarding approximately 20 scholarships each year to academically talented, financially needy juniors and seniors in undergraduate feeder disciplines (including Computer Science, Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, Engineering, and Biological and Geological sciences). The second is to use graduate scholarships to recruit outstanding students into three university-wide interdisciplinary graduate programs (Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Environmental Science, and Neuroscience) by awarding approximately 5 graduate scholarships to students who demonstrate potential for success in graduate school. Undergraduate S-STEM Scholars are given priority for support. The third objective is to increase diversity at the undergraduate and graduate levels by awarding Bridge scholarship funds to students who meet diversity criteria. <br/><br/>Bridge Scholars participate in integrating activities including a seminar series, having a research faculty mentor, and professional development activities. The overall long-term outcome is an increase in the number, quality, and diversity of students who complete undergraduate STEM degrees and graduate degrees in interdisciplinary STEM programs at the university. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Knowledge across disciplines is advanced by enabling students to complete baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields and by recruiting these and other students into interdisciplinary graduate programs. Three team members are successfully managing a current NSF S-STEM project; the other three direct the interdisciplinary graduate programs. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Discovery and understanding are advanced through teaching, student training, and research in the three interdisciplinary graduate programs.

"The Center for Research on Invasive Species and Small Populations (CRISSP) at the University of Idaho (UI) is hosting undergraduate students for a summer of research, learning, and exploration.  CRISSP is a multidisciplinary center that focuses on two areas of pressing regional and global concern: 1) threats posed by invasive species to natural and agricultural resources; and 2) conservation challenges confronting small or declining populations of native species.  During a 9-week summer internship, successful applicants will be immersed in the union of natural resources ecology and technology.  Each REU student will work with a faculty mentor to design and conduct an independent component within the faculty research program.  REU students will have access to modern research facilities including the Laboratory of Conservation and Ecological Genetics, the new Reveley Geospatial Education and Research Complex, the Idaho Stable Isotopes Laboratory, and the Diagnostic and Invasive Plant Mapping Laboratory.  Other activities will include seminars and discussions on scientific methods, critical thinking, and preparation graduate for school and careers in the natural sciences.  Students will participate in a weekend raft trip that will include exploration of environmental ethics as well as the cultural and natural resources of the Salmon River.  Participants will receive a stipend and allowance for housing and subsistence.  Motivated students, especially Native Americans and others from groups that are under-represented in the sciences, are encouraged to apply.

"Of all the common elements in the Earth's crust, iron is the only element that occurs in multiple valence states; it can be found as a pure Fe(0) metal, as Fe(II), or as Fe(III). The valence state of iron thus reflects the amount of oxygen that was present in the environment at the time the mineral crystallized. The amount of oxygen in turn affects how a magma may crystallize: which minerals will form, and in what order. For this reason, measuring the oxidation state of Fe is extremely important in all rock types in which the minerals occur in equilibrium. The valence state of Fe thus serves as a recorder of the evolution of oxygen in the Earth's interior and on its surface. It is also useful in identifying geological formations of economic interest (for example, garnets in diamond-bearing deposits are usually oxidized). The ability to measure Fe valence state is also useful in understanding chemical reactions that control industrial processing of minerals, chemical and metallurgical engineering, recycling of materials, and even the study of health effects and mineralogy.<br/><br/>Historically, it has been very difficult to measure the valence state of Fe in minerals quantitatively. Traditional wet chemistry methods have been used for a half-century, but they require large masses of sample (>1 g) and these are difficult to prepare from rocks that may contain intimate mixtures of fine-grained minerals. Mössbauer spectroscopy is another bulk technique that has more recently been used for measurements of Fe, but it also requires >20 mg of sample. Microfocused X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) presents a promising technology for making Fe3+/total Fe measurements on small spots (8-30 microns) on mineral grains. This technique utilizes the observation that the energy of the Fe K absorption edge and the absorption pre-edge feature found ~15-20 eV below the edge are very sensitive to the oxidation state of Fe. Past measurements of Fe3+/total Fe by this technique have been only semi-quantitative, but recent upgrades at the hard x-ray microprobe beamline x26a at the National Synchrotron Light Source (higher beam intensity and improved energy resolution available from a Si(311) monochromator) have remedied these issues. Thus, the ambitious goal of this proposal is to develop the XANES technique for use as a quantitative microprobe method for analysis of Fe(II) and Fe(III) in minerals.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,64911.00,64911,4900,Petrology and Geochemistry,0808899,,Mickey E Gunter,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,mgunter@uidaho.edu,Mickey,Gunter,,Sonia Esperanca,,['01000809DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/03/2008,07/01/2008,06/30/2011,Collaborative Research: Redox Ratios by Fe-XANES,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,E,,
"PI  Lisette Waits (PI)<br/>Proposal number: IOS-0807314<br/>Title: Using the Pronghorn to Test the Strength of Sexual Selection<br/><br/>Sexual selection, or selection caused by competition over mates, is a major driving force of evolution. To understand sexual selection in the wild, detailed knowledge of individual identities and mating success is required but is rarely available. Recently a model based on the distribution of sexually receptive females in space and time was proposed as a proxy to estimate the strength of sexual selection in the absence of detailed population information (Shuster and Wade 2003). For the first time, the validity of this model will be tested using the population of pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) found on the National Bison Range, Montana. Behavioral observations will be used to calculate the intensity of sexual selection based on the Shuster and Wade (2003) model. These results will be compared to the intensity of sexual selection calculated using genetic paternity analyses. If the model is valid, sexual selection should be a strong force when receptive females are clustered in space and a weak force when they are clustered in time. The estimate of the intensity of sexual selection determined using behavioral data should also correlate with that found using the genetic analyses. As broader impacts, the results of this study will be pertinent to a variety of fields including animal behavior, evolution, and genetics. The data will provide information on basic population parameters to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for use in management of pronghorn. This project involves collaboration between two colleges at the University of Idaho, and will lead to the training of one female Ph.D. student and approximately 12 undergraduate students. Information from this project will not only be presented at scientific conferences, but also to an upper-division biology major Animal Behavior course, to biology students at St. Maries High School in rural St. Maries, Idaho, and to visitors at the National Bison Range.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,12000.00,12000,4900,Animal Behavior,0807314,,Lisette P Waits,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,lwaits@uidaho.edu,Lisette,Waits,melekoni@nsf.gov,Michelle Elekonich,7032927202,['01000809DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],05/27/2008,06/01/2008,09/30/2010,DISSERTATION RESEARCH: A Test of the Generality of the Shuster and Wade Model,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Stacey Dunn'],P,"['Journal of Mammalogy~2008~89~Dunn, S.J. and Byers, J.A.~~1124~~~~Determinants of survival and fecundity through a population bottleneck in pronghorn(Antilocapra americana)~N~~~~~~', 'Molecular Ecology~2008~17~Vali, U., Einarsson, A., Waits, L.P., Elgren, H.~~3808~~~~To what extent do microsatellite markers reflect genome-wide genetic diversity in natural~N~~~~~~', 'Conservation Genetics Resources~2010~~Dunn, S.J.; Barnowe-Meyer, K.K.; Gebhardt, K.J.; Balkenhol, N.; Waits, L.P.; Byers, J.A.~10.1007/s12686-009-9166-9~~~~~Ten polymorphic microsatellite markers for pronghorn (Antilocapra americana)~N~~~~~~']",
"Our overall goal is to have 10 students per year for three years (at least 70% from underrepresented groups) actively participate in a nine-week summer research experience that inspires them to proceed into graduate study and to enter sustainable water resources careers. To achieve this, our Site will provide undergraduates with water resources (both water quantity and water quality) research experiences that: (1) develop students' skills in scientific methods, and equipment and instrumentation use; (2) lead students to greater independence in pursuing their research interests; (3) assist qualified students with under-realized potential in cultivating their capabilities; and (4) offer students professional development and teamwork training through shared activities.

The PASI will have three primary research objectives:  Explore how sustainability principles can be implemented into traditional discipline-specific research and education, particularly the disciplines of hydrology, ecology, and environmental engineering for this PASI,  through integrated interdisciplinary programs such as science plans for environmental observatories; evaluate how native American priorities, understanding, and cultural sustainability can be incorporated into science programs of environmental observatories; and integrate current research and educational programs within the context of the UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Framework or similar frameworks.  <br/><br/>The activity will provide educational and research opportunities to the broader academic community to study watersheds in different political, cultural, geographic and physical settings.  Expected outcomes in this PASI will include:  experience in developing an interdisciplinary framework and quantitative methodology for the valuation of ecosystem functions and services that can guide economic development; understanding of Native American perspectives on development, both North and South American; and a focus on primary gaps in knowledge that may lead to future efforts and nascent collaborations between PASI participants.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.079,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,99370.00,99370,4900,OFFICE OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY AC,0720423,,Peter Goodwin,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,pgoodwin@uidaho.edu,Peter,Goodwin,,Harold Stolberg,,,09/07/2007,09/01/2007,02/28/2009,"PASI: Human, Physical, and Natural Capital Investment in Patagonia: a Predictive Approach Under the Sustainability Criterion; Concepcion, Chile, January 2008",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Darek Nalle', 'Steven B Daley Laursen']",,,
"Soil liquefaction is a geologic hazard that must be addressed in most seismically active regions of the United States and throughout the world to reduce the potential for loss of life and economic impact.  To reduce the potential of liquefaction, various soil improvement methods have been used such as blasting, vibrocompaction, deep dynamic compaction, drains, and grout injection.  These methods, with the exception of injecting grouts, are generally limited to undeveloped sites, and the use of grouts is only economical for treating small volumes of soil.  Due to limitations of existing methods, new methods need to be developed to mitigate liquefaction for developed sites.  Methods currently being studied to accomplish this include passive site stabilization using colloidal silica (Gallagher and Koch 2003, Gallagher and Yuanzhi 2005) and microbial remediation using Flavobacterium johnsonaie (Roth et al. 2005) or Bacillus subtilis (Martinez et al. 2003).  The objective of this study is to demonstrate that introduction of appropriate microbial cells into a soil matrix will promote biomineralization within soil pore spaces such that the likelihood of liquefaction is significantly decreased.<br/><br/>To reduce the potential for liquefaction, two bacteria are being introduced separately into a volume of loose, saturated sand. These bacteria are Leptothrix discophora and Sporosarcina pasteurii.  These bacteria are considered a better alternative for microbial remediation compared to biofilm-forming bacteria because they precipitate iron and manganese or calcite external to their cells.  The anticipated mechanisms for reducing liquefaction are increased density by filling voids and cementation of soil particles during precipitation of the insoluble iron and manganese oxides or calcite.  After precipitating the insoluble oxides, the bacteria can die without significantly degrading the improved shear strength of the soil.  The mechanisms causing an increase in shear strength from introducing Flavobacterium johnsonaie are poorly understood, but the proposers hypothesize that if the Flavobacterium johnsonaie bacteria die, the shear strength may decrease toward pre-treatment levels.<br/><br/>Soil grain size distribution will be quantified and compared with the grain size distribution of non-treated soil to qualitatively assess production of insoluble oxides.  Stiffness, strength and liquefaction resistance are being assessed using shear wave velocity testing with bender elements, miniature cone penetration testing, vane shear testing, and triaxial shear testing.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,383924.00,393524,4900,Geotechnical Engineering and M,0700918,,Barbara C Williams,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,tweaver@uidaho.edu,Thomas,Weaver,,Richard Fragaszy,,['01000809DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],08/20/2007,09/01/2007,06/30/2012,Biomineralization within Soil to Mitigate Seismic-Induced Liquefaction,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Ronald L Crawford'],J,"['Geomicrobiology Journal~2011~28~Burbank, Malcolm B., Thomas J.

"The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that garnet-bearing amphibolites and pelitic schists from the northwest U.S. Cordillera preserve a record of late Mesoproterozoic high pressure metamorphism that can be attributed to significant crustal thickening along the western margin of Laurentia before or during the assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia. To this end a research team from Washington State University, West Virginia University, and University of Idaho are undertaking an integrated geochronologic and metamorphic analysis of garnet-bearing metamorphic assemblages in the northwest U.S. Cordillera in order to: 1) determine the ages of metamorphism using Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd geochronology of garnets and U-Th-Pb geochronology of monazites in order to determine the extent of Proterozoic metamorphism throughout the northwest U.S. Cordillera; 2) establish the pressure-temperature conditions of mineral growth in these metamorphic assemblages; 3) compare the results from the garnet and monazite chronometers and integrate this information with the metamorphic fabrics using detailed petrography; and 4) link both the geochronologic and pressure-temperature information to the penetrative deformational fabrics preserved in the rocks. Establishment of a linkage between late Mesoproterozoic metamorphism and the high temperature, high-pressure assemblages that exist in these rocks over a considerable area will show that a major period of crustal thickening during convergent tectonism occurred on the western margin of Laurentia at the end of the Mesoproterozoic. The presence of an approximately one billion year old contractional belt in the northwestern U.S., if confirmed, would imply that the history of metamorphism and deformation in the Cordillera is more complicated than previously appreciated. These results would provide important piercing points for late Mesoproterozoic tectonic reconstructions. In particular, results of this project will provide additional constraints on correlations of western Laurentia with other cratonal fragments such as Australia, Siberia, Antarctica, and China and will ultimately impact various reconstructions of Rodinia.<br/><br/>The Grenville orogeny was an important event that substantially modified the North American continent approximately one billion years ago. The metamorphic rocks produced in this event can be found in wide belt that extends from eastern Canada to southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico. Preliminary geochronological data yielded the unexpected result that metamorphism of this age also occurred in the northwestern U.S. To confirm these data, this project is using new geochronological methods to determine the ages of minerals that are commonly produced during the metamorphism that occurs during mountain belt formation. If the preliminary results are born out, current understanding of the nature of the Grenville event will require revision.

"Abstract<br/><br/>Proposal Number   CTS-0643023<br/>Principal Investigator:  Aaron M. Thomas<br/>University/Institution:  University of Idaho   <br/><br/><br/>CAREER: Oscillating Flows as a Novel Mechanical Separation Method<br/>for Macroscale and Microscale Applications<br/><br/>Oscillating or pulsatile flows can be used as a novel mechanical separation and transport mechanism for species in the gas and liquid phase. Oscillating flows are unique in that the separation is dictated by the difference in the molecular diffusion of a gas or<br/>liquid species. A primary goal is to explore and elucidate a novel mechanical method for the separation of species in gas and liquid systems using oscillating flows at both the<br/>macro and micro scales. This research will involve 1) prediction of species movement at<br/>different time and length scales using theoretical models, and 2) experiments to validate and correct these models. The first key objective is to perform theoretical and experimental research on the macroscale. Specifically, unique geometrical configurations such as tubes with wavy walled boundaries will be analyzed to determine the effect of geometry on the flow profiles and thus the separation and mass transfer of species in mixtures. Ultimately, a system having a large separation with a high throughput is needed. The second key objective is to carry out research on the microscale with simple liquid systems in microchannels to fully understand the effect of AC fields on fluid movement and species transport.  More complex biological separations such as DNA and proteins will be studied.  The PI's educational goal is to train students at all levels graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 to think critically, communicate effectively, and solve problems. At the university level, new laboratory experiments will be developed and integrated into the curriculum. These classes will encourage undergraduate students to continue their education with a graduate degree. Within the community, the PI will strive to encourage K-12 students, especially Native American students, to enter the sciences. To accomplish this, he will perform demonstrations at local schools and on the local Nez Perce and Coeur d'Alene reservations. Further, the PI has plans to help Native American students make the transition to college life so that improve their college retention and to help them obtain advanced degrees.<br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,405244.00,414244,4900,Interfacial Engineering Progra,0643023,,Aaron M Thomas,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,aaron.thomas@mso.umt.edu,Aaron,Thomas,,Rosemarie D.

"This award supports a project to examine an existing ice core of opportunity from South Pole (SPRESO core) to develop a 2000+ year long climate record. SPRESO ice core will be an annually dated, sub-annually-resolved reconstruction of past climate (atmospheric circulation, temperature, precipitation rate, and atmospheric chemistry) utilizing continuous, co-registered measurements (n=45) of: major ions, trace elements, and stable isotope series, plus selected sections for microparticle size and composition. The intellectual merit of this project relates to the fact that few 2000+ year records of this quality exist in Antarctica despite increasing scientific interest in this critical time period as the framework within which to understand modern climate. The scientific impact of this ice core investigation are that it will provide an in-depth understanding of climate variability; a baseline for assessing modern climate variability in the context of human activity; and a contribution to the prediction of future climate variability. The broader impact of this work is that the proposed research addresses important questions concerning the role of Antarctica in past, present, and future global change. Results will be translated into publicly accessible information through public lectures, media appearances, and an extensive outreach activity housed in our Institute. Our ice core activities provide a major basis for curriculum in K-12 and University plus a basis for several field and laboratory based graduate theses and undergraduate student projects.

"0612630<br/>Bayomy<br/><br/>Description: This project supports collaborative research by Dr. Fouad Bayomy, Department of Civil Engineering, University of Idaho (UI), Moscow, Idaho and Dr. Safwan Khedr, Construction Engineering Department, the American University in Cairo (AUC), Egypt. The goal of the project is to characterize the Egyptian asphalt mixes using modern advanced techniques that are part of the Superpave mix design system and are required to develop pavement design parameters that are needed for a new mechanistic-empirical (M-E) design method. The current flexible pavement design method is empirical and does not relate to the mechanical properties of the asphalt mixes. It relies primarily on the 1986-1993 AASHTO design guide, which is currently moving towards a new (M-E) pavement design system.  The project has two phases. First, to investigate and develop analytical relationships or models that relate the basic properties of asphalt binders and aggregates to the mix properties. Second, to perform dynamic characterization of asphalt mixtures and its materials. All dynamic testing will be conducted at the AUC laboratory in Egypt. Aggregates and mixtures testing using imaging techniques to determine micro structure parameters and its relation to the mix design parameters will be performed at UI. The PI and a graduate student from UI will travel to work with the AUC team on the recently developed pavement technologies. Dr. Khedr and a junior scientist from AUC will visit the UI to work on the project. In addition to reports and papers publication, research findings will be disseminated via a training workshop to be held in Cairo at the end of the project.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project will advance the pavement engineering science by seeking the development of analytical as well as empirical relationships and models that relate the dynamic properties of the hot-mix asphalt (HMA) to the properties of its constituents. Such relationships will enhance the current HMA mix design and evaluation using the Superpave techniques. Furthermore, the dynamic characterization of these mixes will allow for linking the mix design to the pavement structural design using the new mechanistic-empirical (M-E) pavement design method, which is soon to be implemented in the US and in many other countries.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: In addition to facilitating collaboration between the US and Egyptian institutions, this project should impact the advancement of pavement design and construction technologies not only in Egypt but also in the USA.  It will lead to a new pavement design code in Egypt.  One student from the University of Idaho will participate in the research in Egypt, and at least one junior scientist from Egypt will participate in the research at the University of Idaho. The training workshop at the end of the project will allow for practical implementation of the research findings and personnel professional development in pavement design and construction technologies.<br/><br/>This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.079,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,0.00,29982,4900,,0612630,,Fouad M.

"Plasmids are genetic elements that often carry antibiotic resistance factors, pollutant degradation genes or code for traits that are useful for their bacterial hosts. Because plasmids can transfer among different bacterial species, they play an important role in the ability of bacteria to degrade environmental contaminants and to become resistant to drugs used to treat infectious diseases of plants, animals and humans. However, little is known about the genetic structure of these mobile elements, the full range of functions that they encode, and the limits to which they can transfer to various organisms. To gain insight into the issues outlined above, this genome sequencing project will focus on the analysis of the genome sequences of 100 plasmids that have a broad host-range (also called BHR plasmids). The sequenced plasmids were obtained from soil, water, and sewage sludge samples from around the globe. The project includes finishing the sequencing and annotation of the plasmids, and then interpreting the sequence information to better understand the evolutionary history of plasmids, and their role in bacterial chromosome evolution and adaptation to new environments. The information collected during this project will add significant new data to the paltry plasmid sequence database that now exists, which is also skewed towards plasmids relevant to human infectious diseases. <br/><br/>This study is unique, as it will constitute the first comprehensive expedition to discover the genetic traits encoded by BHR plasmids and to understand the genetic structure of these mobile elements and their role in gene transfer between chromosomes of bacteria. Moreover, the types of plasmids characterized will be extended beyond those that are found in human pathogens and easily cultivated bacteria. The knowledge gained will be of fundamental importance to understanding the evolution and adaptation of bacteria, and of practical significance in developing strategies to exploit plasmid encoded traits and in evaluating the risks associated with the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment. The genome sequences of 100 BHR plasmids will be made available to the science community through Genbank as well as through recently constructed plasmid databases. The project will integrate this research with educational programs by involving students from Idaho's undergraduate colleges and local high schools, with special emphasis on Native American and Hispanic students. Efforts to disseminate the work beyond the normal distribution channels will focus on Web delivery that will include several features designed to provide useful information for middle school through college students, their teachers and advisors as well as the public. These features will include innovative information graphics, audio and video podcasts focused on ""Issues in Science"", a frequently updated blog, and laboratory lesson examples to share with middle and high school teachers.

"Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The University of Idaho will acquire a state-of-the-art confocal Raman scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) system. The system integrates AFM modes for liquid and air probing and SNOM, digital pulsed force mode AFM for quantitative materials analysis, Raman spectroscopy with short and long (NIR) wavelength excitation, single photon counting detector, confocal, fluorescence, reflection and transmission microscopy, and sample stage heating to 200 degrees C. The system will be utilized across a broad range of materials science and engineering, physics, and chemistry, where disciplines merge into nanotechnology and microscale phenomena. This instrument has spatial resolution of <10 nm with simultaneous optical and Raman scanning at <100 nm resolution. The unique integration will facilitate unprecedented studies on chemical, mechanical and materials properties of solids, liquids, gels, coatings, plastics, powders, and composites. Applications include studies of site-specific chemical bonding of nanomaterials and analytes in environmental sensors, nanowire and nanofiber chemical functionality, biofilm evolution and morphology, interfacial mechanics and chemistry of composites, chemical architecture of plant cell walls and wood fibers. Access will facilitate multidisciplinary research and will be an indispensable training component for tomorrow's scientists and engineers. This instrument will be one-of-a-kind in the Pacific Northwest (1 of 4 in North America), filling a vast regional gap in access to its unique capabilities.

"Understanding how species coevolve within complex ecological communities is one of the greatest technical challenges in evolutionary biology. Mathematical models of coevolution with even modest amounts of biological reality usually defy transparent, general analyses of coevolution. This project will develop innovative mathematical tools for analyzing coevolution in complex communities, including both evolutionary and population dynamics. The two main analytic approaches will make use of different mathematical approximations available when the strength of selection is relatively weak or strong. The scope and accuracy of these new methods will be verified using computer simulations. The new mathematical tools will also be used to address two important questions in community coevolution. First, does the number of potential hosts influence transitions between generalist and specialist parasites? Second, does coevolution lead to different ecological network structure in mutualistic vs. antagonistic communities? In each case, theoretical predictions will be tested in the laboratories of empirical collaborators. Ongoing studies of host use in bacteriophage will evaluate predictions for specialist-generalist transitions in parasites; data from well-studied plant-insect interactions will test predictions for the coevolution of community network structure.<br/><br/>The proposed work will contribute to the continued integration of analytic methods into the biological sciences. Results will be widely disseminated through publication, scientific presentations, and software packages developed during the project. Training will introduce at least three post-doctoral researchers, four graduate students, and five undergraduates to cutting-edge analytical and computational techniques. The research collaboration also reinforces existing interactions between biology and mathematics departments in geographically proximate Washington State University and the University of Idaho.

Predicting how evolution influences the structure, function, and stability of these complex ecological communities is a long standing challenge in ecology. What makes prediction so difficult in these cases is that, at a bare minimum, evolutionary change within each species must be described. Although this can be straightforward for small communities (e.g., three or four species), it becomes a formidable mathematical and computational challenge as the number of species increases. Work on this project developed new mathematical and computational tools that allow evolution within species rich communities to be effectively studied.                  In addition to developing a general set of mathematical tools that allow evolution to be studied within complex communities, work on this project addressed several specific topics of applied importance.  To highlight one example, led by Dr. Emily Jones, a postdoctoral researcher supported by this grant, we investigated a long-standing prediction that biological invasions are more likely to be initiated by species that are distantly related to those currently within the native community. Using some of the mathematical tools developed earlier in this project, we formalized earlier verbal predictions. Our results show that, although evolutionary relationships do have power to predict whether a species will invade a native community, whether distantly or closely related species are more likely to invade depends on the ecological details of species interactions. This work will help to develop more effective tools for assessing the threat posed by potentially invasive species.                  Another important accomplishment of this project was training post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students to use mathematical models and computer simulations to better understand and predict biological processes. Among those individuals trained on this grant, the postdoctoral researchers moved onto academic research positions, the graduate student moved on to a job at an information technology company (GFI Informatique), one undergraduate student went on to medical school, and another undergraduate student went on to graduate school.

"This is a continuation of the Environmental Science theme of a previous REU at the University of Idaho, with but  focus on water resources topics. The term ""water resources"" means: the study  of how water moves through and interacts with natural systems, and the physical, social, and economic  aspects of human and ecosystem interaction with the water cycle.  The overall goal is to involve 10 undergraduates each summer for  three years, with at least 70% from underrepresented groups (women and ethnic minorities), in a  nine-week summer research experience that inspires them to proceed into graduate study and to  enter water resources careers. To achieve this, the Site will provide undergraduates with water  resources research experiences that    develop students' skills in scientific methods, and equipment and instrumentation use;    lead students to greater independence in pursuing their research interests;    assist qualified students with under-realized potential in cultivating their capabilities;    offer students professional development and teamwork training through shared activities.  The project team includes several NSF-sponsored researchers who solve complex  problems of current significance in well-instrumented experimental watersheds using leading-edge tools  and techniques. Participants in this REU Site program gain first-hand insights into scientific procedures  while earning a competitive edge in entering and successfully completing graduate programs and  successful careers in water resources. They will achieve this by selecting and participating in research  projects under the direction of faculty competitively funded by NSF, USDA, USGS, and NOAA.  REU students participate as  team members in their mentor's research group. Students also develop collegial relationships as an REU  group by participating together in scholarly and recreational activities, such as weekly REU research  forums and lunches with professional and academic role models, an ""ethics-in-science"" workshop, and  weekend field trips led by faculty mentors. The students will rotate into other labs for a minimum of one day each to interact academically with  their peers. The plan is to have at least 70% from underrepresented groups (women and ethnic minorities), with 50% from ethnic  minorities (up from an overall average of 25% for the existing REU Site); at least 80% of the students in each year's cohort from non-PhD-granting institutions (up from the  70% overall average for the existing REU Site); at least 50% of each year's participants co-author publications and/or present their research at  national conferences.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,239470.00,239470,4900,EWFD-Eng Workforce Development,0552925,,Fritz R Fiedler,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,fritz@uidaho.edu,Fritz,Fiedler,lpatino@nsf.gov,Lina Patino,7032925047,,05/23/2006,06/01/2006,05/31/2008,REU Site: Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates in Water Resources,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Kathleen Kavanagh'],R,,
"0549220<br/>Wood<br/><br/>This project involves the acquisition, installation and testing of two pieces of equipment for the analysis of natural waters, rocks, soils, and products of laboratory experiments at the University of Idaho. The instruments are: 1) an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) which permits determination of most chemical elements at low concentrations in geological samples; and 2) an ion chromatograph (IC) which is used to analyze waters for anions like chloride and sulfate. These instruments are used by several groups of Earth Scientists at the University of Idaho and nearby Washington State University, including geochemists, geomicrobiologists, mineralogists, igneous petrologists, hydrologists and soil scientists. <br/> <br/>The new ICP-AES and IC support a variety of studies in the earth sciences. These include, but are not limited to, studies that contribute to a better understanding of: 1) how economic deposits of platinum-group elements and molybdenum are formed; 2) the behavior of radionuclides in soils and natural waters; 3) fault hydrology in geothermal systems; 4) the use of a group of minerals called zeolites in the remediation of waters contaminated with radionuclides and heavy metals: 5) the fate of asbestos in the human lung; 6) the biogeochemistry of life in extreme environments; 7) how microbes influence the geochemistry of the toxic metals selenium and arsenic; 8) the eruptive styles of volcanoes; 9) the environment of deposition of fossils at the Hagermann Fossil Beds National Monument in Idaho. All of these projects have significant socioeconomic applications. <br/><br/>In addition to projects at the University of Idaho and Washington State University, the new instruments are available to other users in the region on a fee-for-service basis.

"Intellectual Merit: This project concerns geodetic and geophysical monitoring of two distinct active volcanoes in the Galapagos Islands to understand magma transport and storage, and the balance between shallow intrusion and eruption, all of which have important implications for volcanic hazards assessment. <br/><br/>GPS observations at Sierra Negra volcano since 2000 showed a dramatic increase in the rate of inflation over the past two years, culminating on April 16, 2005 with inelastic failure of the magma chamber roof along a trapdoor fault, and subsequent eruptions in the Fall.  Faulting of the caldera floor may have a profound effect on magma storage and the degassing history of the subcaldera magma reservoir. One hypothesis is that trapdoor faulting relaxes elastic stress related to intrusion and inflation, allowing larger volumes of magma to be stored inside the volcano instead of erupting. Serial measurements of volcanic gas emissions and gravity changes, along with updates to existing GPS networks will provide means to test this hypothesis. The first phase of the project will continue monitoring of deformation at Sierra Negra by maintaining the continuous L1 and L1/L2 GPS network installed in 2002 and conducting a follow-up GPS campaign. The GPS results will be integrated with InSAR measurements in order to take advantage of the spatial coverage of that technique. Simultaneous measurement of volcanic gases emitted from fumaroles will monitor degassing processes in response to volume changes in the shallow magma reservoir. Gravity measurements will provide complementary constraints on volume and mass changes in the reservoir at depth. Results of this study will provide constraints on the material properties of the magma and edifice, geochemical and mechanical changes related to variable rates of chamber filling, and the causes and consequences of edifice failure leading to intrusion or eruption.<br/><br/>Fernandina volcano began erupting on May 13, 2005 from a fissure system located on the southwestern caldera rim. This form of eruptive vent, termed a circumferential fissure, is common to Galapagos shield volcanoes and is thought to be governed by stresses acting within the volcano from both gravitational forces on the slopes and magma chamber inflation. One hypothesis is that circumferential fissures and radial intrusions, which occur on the lower flanks of Galapagos shield volcanoes, coexist as the result of strain field interaction. Interestingly, the previous eruption of Fernandina in 1995 was from a radial eruptive fissure on the southwest flank, immediately below the site of the 2005 eruption. The GPS campaign network installed at Fernandina with prior NSF funding was designed to capture a circumferential event like the one that has just occurred, with a dense array of sites in the vicinity of the eruption. At Fernandina, a post-eruption GPS campaign will be implemented to better understand the strain field and mechanisms of fissure formation. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The proposed project will provide collaborative research experience for students and faculty from Ph.D.-granting institutions, undergraduate colleges, and Ecuadorian universities, and in coordination with the Charles Darwin Research Station to continue outreach efforts in educational programs for visitors and local residents.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,224000.00,224000,4900,Petrology and Geochemistry,0538205,,Dennis J Geist,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,dgeist@uidaho.edu,Dennis,Geist,,William P.

"This work will continue the analyses of several aspects of snow spectral emissivity and<br/>cloud processes, and will be extended to analyze the complete surface energy budget and to make<br/>comparisons with an antarctic mesoscale atmospheric model.  The work is based on a year-long field experiment, the South Pole Atmospheric Radiation and Cloud Lidar Experiment (SPARCLE), carried out during 2001 at South Pole Station.   The two primary efforts will be 1) determining monthly values of shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes, sensible heat, latent heat, and subsurface heat flux, in order to quantify uncertainties and defining the accuracy to which the energy budget can be closed, and 2) comparing predictions of the Polar Mesoscale Model (PMM5) to the observed surface energy budget components and clouds, and diagnosing causes of any discrepancies.<br/><br/>The atmosphere over the Antarctic Plateau plays a unique role in the global climate system. It is the coldest and driest atmosphere on earth, with radiation processes dominating both the surface and the top-of-atmosphere energy budgets.   When spectrally resolved, longwave radiation is extremely useful for remote sensing of atmospheric and surface properties, particularly in the polar winter.  <br/><br/>The analysis products are expected to stimulate and support research in other areas, including remote sensing, climate modeling, and weather forecasting in Antarctica for potential year-round logistical operations.

"0549324<br/>Oldow<br/><br/>This grant will support an Earth sciences community workshop to identify ground-based digital acquisition, analysis, and visualization needs of the geological science community.  A two workshop will be organized under the direction of John Oldow at the University of Idaho and is planned for early Winter, 2006.  A current challenge for many geoscientists is access and training in the use of digital field mapping tools as well as the intricacies of merging digital datasets acquired at differing resolutions and using multiple tools.  The development of user-friendly, open source software for processing and analysis of digital mapping products is a clear need and a considerable challenge.  The workshop will focus on the possible development of a new facility/services to support state-of-the-art digital geologic field mapping using technologies including terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), GPS, digital photogrammetry, and remotely sensed imagery (e.g., satellite or airborne multispectral imagery), as well as more traditional field mapping tools.  The facility concept has been termed INTERFACE (INTERdisciplinary Alliance for Digital Field Data ACquisition and Exploration) and would provide equipment, training, data processing, data archiving, and visualization facilities to researchers and students across the United States to support direct digital data acquisition and visualization of surficial landforms.  Specific goals of the workshop are to: (1) identify the methods and technologies needed for digital data acquisition, (2) to explore database and analysis tool requirements, (3) outline a vision for the architecture of national system for equipment accessibility, training, analysis, and data archiving, (4) initiate a discussion on data standards, required metadata, and information formats for databases, (5) identify the visualization requirements associated with digital acquisition methods, (6) develop a strategy for community involvement and implementation of the digital acquisition system, and (7) outline the relation of the digital acquisition system to existing or planned cyberinfrastructural initiatives in the earth sciences. Attendance of about 25 earth scientists representing a wide range of expertise is planned.  Participants will be drawn  from the geomorphology, structure, seismic and geodetic communities, with targeted invitations to those with experience in digital acquisition, database development, information management, and the application of data analysis tools.  The findings of the workshop will be presented to the geologic community at the 2006 National Meeting of the Geological Society of America and the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in addition to a report submitted directly to the EAR/IF Program and available to the community via electronic distribution and access on the GEON website (geongrid.org).<br/><br/>***<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,38697.00,38697,4900,Instrumentation & Facilities,0549324,,John S Oldow,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,oldow@utdallas.edu,John,Oldow,,Russell Kelz,,,11/21/2005,12/01/2005,11/30/2007,"WORKSHOP TO IDENTIFY GROUND-BASED DIGITAL AQUISITION, ANALYSIS, AND VISUALIZATION NEEDS OF THE GEOLOGICAL SCIENCE COMMUNITY",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,S,"['Geophysical Union, EOS Transactions~2006~87~Oldow, J.S., Walker, J.D., Aiken, C.L.V., and Xu, X.~~351~~~~Digital acquisition, analysis, and visualization in the earth sciences~N~~~~~~']",
"Coevolution is an important driver in species interactions.  We already know that it can drive diversification in morphology and ecology among more-or-less isolated populations in ecological time. An important next question is whether this variation persists in such a way as to contribute to generating species diversity, or if it is lost amidst changing ecological context. This project provides a first test of this question. It uses the obligate, beneficial relationship between the well-known Joshua Tree and its exclusive pollinators, two yucca moth species. These moths occur either alone or coexist in different parts of the joshua tree range. It is an excellent model because the association has persisted for a very long time, and plant and moth traits have diversified between and within the species. Furthermore, the geographic range of joshua tree is highly fragmented and has a well-understood history of variable connectivity during past climate regimens. Specifically, the project will use molecular and morphological data to test predictions about historical gene flow, current isolation, and morphological variation. Together they can provide strong answers to the question about the role of coevolution in driving speciation.  <br/><br/> The results will be of immediate broader utility in conservation biology, as the answers would affect genetically informed conservation strategies, and in climate change biology, where yuccas are sensitive indicator species. Being a species of great public interest and a symbol of the Mojave desert, and a key species for maintenance of desert communities, the results will have immediate application for public agencies. In a broader educational context, yuccas and yucca moths figure prominently in textbooks, and in public education settings such as science centers and parks. The project will further outreach in these areas, and provide public and ranger education in parks and monuments.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,0.00,454478,4900,POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG,0516841,,N.

"Proposal:  EPS-0447689<br/><br/>Proposal Title: Idaho Research Infrastructure Improvement <br/><br/>Institution:  University of Idaho <br/><br/><br/>The Idaho EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement award will, strengthen shared facilities, build capacity, and enhance research competitiveness in the general area of water quality and uses relating to environmental change - specifically for five integrated research themes: 1) hydrologic processes relating to the global debate on ""Old Water"" and it's variable chemistry, 2) carbon/water flux at the local soil-vegetation-atmosphere scale, 3) carbon/water export from watersheds and nutrient limitation, 4) fish physiology and genomics, and 5) aqueous environmental nanosensors.  A diversity of researchers from the University of Idaho, Idaho State University, and Boise State University will be brought together in the kind of collaborative environment essential for useful and meaningful infrastructure improvement to increase competitiveness for federal research support.   A highly instrumented Idaho Experimental Watershed Network will be established; data management and analysis capabilities will be strengthened for the Hydroinformatics Facility of the new Idaho Water Center; and a state-of-the-art regional water quality laboratory will be developed to strengthen collaborations with Idaho and regional Native American tribes as well as national and international researchers.  This project will contribute to scientific understanding of environmental geochemical cycles and water quality and potentially to national and global policy formulation.<br/><br/>Undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral associates will be involved in research related to the five specified themes and graduate programs will be restructured to further the integration of research and education within the universities.  Existing educational and public outreach programs will be strengthened to attract more students to scientific and engineering studies/careers and to increase public awareness of the role of research in higher education and its contribution to the state's economic growth.  In particular, current, working relationships with Idaho's Native American Tribes in both research and education will be expanded to other states, engaging the broader Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission.  Outreach efforts to the private sector also include a Phase 0 SBIR program, offering assistance with development and writing of more successful SBIR proposals to different agencies.  The project offers strong potential for strengthening and expanding agriculture, aquaculture and related industries in Idaho.<br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.083,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,0.00,9250000,4900,EPSCoR Research Infrastructure,0447689,,Jean'ne M Shreeve,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,jshreeve@uidaho.edu,Jean'ne,Shreeve,jsmall@nsf.gov,Jeanne Small,7032928623,['01000809DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],06/09/2005,06/01/2005,02/28/2009,Idaho Research Infrastructure Improvement,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Peter Goodwin', 'Gregory A Bohach']",M,"['Journal of Materials Research~2005~20~LaLonde, Aaron D.; David N.

"In high temperature geothermal systems, and magmatic hydrothermal systems such as the porphyry copper deposit at Butte, Montana, sharp decreases in pressure from lithostatic toward hydrostatic are a likely process for producing quartz veins.  The nearly universal occurrence of molybdenite (MoS2) in such quartz veins that likely form by pressure drop and the scarcity of molybdenite in other vein types suggest that molybdenite, like quartz, precipitates by pressure reduction, as opposed to a decrease in temperature.  Previous molybdenite solubility experiments have not addressed the role of pressure, thus we do not know a chemical mechanism that would cause molybdenite to precipitate upon a drop in pressure.  For quartz, we know its solubility as a function of pressure, but we do not know the origin of quartz mineral and trace element compositions that distinguish pressure-drop vein quartz from other types of quartz. This research addresses pressure decrease as a key process in magmatic hydrothermal systems in three coordinated sub-projects: (1) experiments in the Wood laboratory (U. Idaho) to explore molybdenite solubility as a function of pressure and temperature, (2) in the Reed laboratory (U. Oregon), determine the SEM-cathodoluminescence textures and related trace element compositions, 18O/16O ratios and fluid inclusion properties in natural vein quartz formed by pressure drop and other processes; and (3) apply numerical modeling methods (program CHILLER) to explore the role of pressure-decrease in magmatic hydrothermal systems.  Benefits beyond the research itself include the following: a) graduate students and two undergraduates would be trained in the analytical, experimental, and computational methods involved in modern geochemical research; b) the Reed-Wood research collaboration joins complementary strengths in experimental, analytical and numerical modeling geochemistry that would aid future developments in geochemistry; c) a deeper understanding of magmatic hydrothermal processes is important for mineral exploration and for future energy extraction from high-temperature (>400 degrees C), high-yield geothermal systems, such as that now being drilled in Iceland.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,151335.00,151335,4900,Petrology and Geochemistry,0440324,,Scott A Wood,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,swood@uidaho.edu,Scott,Wood,,Sonia Esperanca,,,01/31/2005,02/01/2005,01/31/2008,Collaborative Research: Pressure Decrease as a Cause of Quartz and Molybdenite Vein Mineral Precipitation in Magmatic-Hydrothermal Systems,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,A,"['Economic Geology~2006~101~Y.

"CAREER:  An Integrated Research and Education Plan to Develop and Deploy a Pointable, Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Instrument on a Tethered Balloon<br/><br/><br/>Images of the earth taken by satellite and aircraft-based remote sensing instruments offer an immensely valuable, yet limited perspective.  While remote sensing technologies have revolutionized the study of the earth system by enabling large surface areas to be imaged quickly and frequently, various limitations can restrict the spatial resolution (i.e. pixel size) of remote sensing data to the point where observable surface detail is insufficient to study critical environmental processes.  As a result, complex mathematical procedures are often necessary to derive ""sub-pixel"" fractions of various ground cover types such as trees, grasses, bare soil, and water.  To complement and validate these mathematical procedures, novel remote sensing techniques are needed to bridge the gap between small-scale, ground-based observations and larger scale aircraft- and satellite-based measurements. A instrument  will be developed that can be attached to the tether line of a large, unmanned blimp and raised and lowered to view the earth across a range of intermediate perspectives.<br/> An integrated research/education program at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&amp;T) will develop and deploy a lightweight, state-of-the-art remote sensing instrument package for use on such a tethered balloon platform.  Graduate students and faculty in the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences will team with undergraduate engineering students participating in the SDSM&amp;T Center of Excellence for Advanced Manufacturing and Production (CAMP) and Senior Design Courses to design, construct, and test the instrument.  In addition, the instrument will be used to develop a remote sensing educational module for integration into the SDSM&amp;T Scientific Knowledge for Indian Learning and Leadership (SKILL) summer program for pre-college Native American students.  Instrument development will occur incrementally during each academic year of the five-year development period.  Upon the completion of each stage of instrument development, graduate students and the Principal Investigator will use the instrument to conduct several remote sensing experiments made possible by the balloon platform.  For example, the balloon platform will be used to investigate how cover estimates of sub-pixel landscape components using various mathematical ""spectral mixture analysis"" techniques can be validated and improved.  By the end of the project, the hyperspectral instrument platform will be capable of stable flight, real-time instrument-to-ground data transmission, and will be remotely pointable from the ground.  <br/>The overarching goals of this work are 1) to foster collaboration between student scientists and engineers, 2) to utilize the results of this collaboration in order to conduct novel research and make advances in terrestrial remote sensing, and 3) to make this technology and research familiar to minority students and encourage them to pursue careers in science and technology. <br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,0.00,198329,4900,INSTRUMENTAT & INSTRUMENT DEVP,0537040,,Lee Vierling,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,leev@uidaho.edu,Lee,Vierling,,Nily R.

Identification of keystone species within a system is critical to understanding how communities presently function and how they might respond to future environmental changes.  Fire is a natural process in western Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests, but human activities (i.e. logging and fire suppression) have altered fire frequencies and intensities.  This project will address the influence of fire on the relative importance and possible keystone function of different woodpecker species on the secondary cavity user (SCU) community in pine forests in the Black Hills of South Dakota.  Secondary cavity users do not excavate the cavities that they occupy for nesting and roosting.  I will examine woodpecker and SCU communities in three types of treatments: unburned (i.e. control), prescribed fire, and old burn treatments.  The prescribed fire treatments will undergo two years of pre-burn analysis before application of a prescribed burn.  The focus of forests in different stages of post-fire succession will allow for an examination of the dynamic influence of fire on the woodpeckers and the SCU communities. The relative importance of individual woodpecker species to the SCU community will be determined by monitoring the use of woodpecker cavities during both the breeding season and non-breeding season.  Wind Cave National Park will be the primary site for field research and for a field ecology curriculum to be taught to American Indian students.  This study provides a unique opportunity to integrate research and ecological educational activities with American Indian students by combining a culturally relevant field site (Wind Cave) with culturally relevant animals (woodpeckers). The field ecology experiences will be the result of collaboration between the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&amp;T), Oglala Lakota College (OLC), and the SDSM&amp;T Scientific Knowledge for Indian Learning and Leadership (SKILL) program.  The combination of research activities and educational activities at Wind Cave will provide excellent opportunities to integrate research and education to a group that has traditionally been underrepresented in the sciences.  <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,0.00,445323,4900,POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG,0534815,,Kerri T Vierling,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,kerriv@uidaho.edu,Kerri,Vierling,,Alan Tessier,,['04000203DB NSF Education & Human Resource'],08/09/2005,01/01/2005,02/28/2009,"CAREER:    A Keystone Species Approach to Determining Post-fire Successional Influence on Cavity user Communities in the Black Hills, South Dakota",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,T,"['The Science Teacher~2005~72~Vierling, K.T., J.

"Hekla volcano in southern Iceland displays a remarkable correspondence between its style of volcanic activity and extent of petrologic evolution. Most eruptions are zoned, especially the ones that punctuate long repose, initiating with an explosive siliceous phase and ending with effusion of mafic icelandite. The pioneering work of Thorarinsson showed that the extent of differentiation at Hekla correlates with the repose between eruptions. This project is designed to study in detail the zoned products of the historical eruptions, in order to elucidate the mechanisms and timescales of differentiation. Field work will be conducted in order to collect sequences of samples from each historical eruption; because the eruptions are all historical, the minimum time for crystallization, mixing, and differentiation is well-constrained. Each of the rocks will be analyzed using modern, state of the art techniques, but the focus of this study is microanalysis of phenocryst phases, which are tracers of the liquid compositions from which they crystallized. Major and trace element zoning profiles of phenocrysts and analyses of melt inclusions will help determine the parentage of the phenocrysts, as well as the duration they have been entrained in their host magmas. Oxygen isotopic ratios of the phenocrysts and water analyses of melt inclusions record the extent to which water influences magmatic evolution. Finally, relatively short-lived actinide-series isotopic analyses of the phenocrysts will constrain their age, the amount of time they have resided in the magmatic plumbing system. <br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, this award will support the research endeavors of a doctoral student at the University of Idaho and six Colgate University undergraduates.

The Colgate students, in turn, will have the opportunity to participate in extended fieldwork, interact with research scientists, work on independent, focused research questions.

Organized by Dr. Klaus Jorde of the University of Idaho, the institute will involve 11 lecturers and over 40 students from North and South America.  The purpose of the institute is to explore the boundaries of sustainability of aquatic systems through adaptive management.  The long-term goal is to promote collaborative research and education programs in this important area. <br/><br/>The PASI will explore how closely the conservation of biodiversity can co-exist alongside water resource development, with specific emphasis on hydropower projects.  Two meetings will be hosted to present the current state of understanding in the Americas and to coordinate current research activities and student exchanges at participating institutions.  A scientific framework considering adaptive management will be developed in order to learn from observed ecological consequences of hydropower projects and improve criteria for designing future projects and selecting river systems that should be protected. <br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.079,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,99370.00,99370,4900,OFFICE OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY AC,0418542,,Klaus Jorde,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,jorde@uidaho.edu,Klaus,Jorde,,Harold Stolberg,,['04000405DB NSF Education & Human Resource'],08/31/2004,11/01/2004,10/31/2005,"PASI:  Balancing Hydropower Development and Biodiversity: Is Sustainability in an Adaptive Management Framework Achievable?;  Concepcion, Chile, January 2005",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,,
"This project creates a Reconfigurable Attack-Defend Instructional Computing Laboratory (RADICL) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Idaho (UI). The UI is a NSF Scholarship for Service (SFS, aka CyberCorps) school and a NSA Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE).  The UI Department of Computer Science played the lead role in both of those efforts and designations.  However, while the institution and department have adequate facilities for nominal Computer Science and Information Assurance (CS/IA) education, there are almost no instructional computing facilities to enable state-of-the-art pedagogy in attack-defend scenarios. Hands-on experience with these topics requires a laboratory computer network that is both isolated (so it won't impact or contaminate day-to-day computing facilities) and reconfigurable (to allow diverse operating systems, network topologies, and defensive strategies).  There is currently no such facility available to UI faculty specializing in CS/IA education.

"This research is about a theory of new- and oldforms for irreducible<br/>admissible representations of the algebraic group PGSp(4,F), for F a<br/>nonarchimedean local field of characteristic zero. The first objective<br/>of this research is to prove the main conjecture, supported by<br/>extensive evidence, which asserts that a generic representation admits<br/>a nonzero vector fixed by a paramodular group of some level; that at<br/>the minimal level such a vector is unique up to nonzero scalars; and<br/>that at the minimal level a suitable normalization of such a vector,<br/>called a newform, computes the L-factor of the representation. The<br/>second objective is to prove a precise conjecture about the structure<br/>of the spaces of oldforms in a generic representation, i.e., the spaces<br/>of vectors fixed by paramodular groups of level exceeding the minimal<br/>level. The third, and final, objective is to investigate whether a<br/>version of the main conjecture holds for nongeneric representations at<br/>the level of L- or A-packets.<br/><br/>Briefly summarized, number theory is the part of mathematics concerned<br/>with the study of integral solutions to algebraic equations. Though the<br/>problems of number theory often can be simply stated,  solutions may<br/>require extensive theoretical development and input from other parts of<br/>mathematics. Broadly characterized, this research seeks to tie<br/>together, in a useful and new way, two parts of number theory.  The<br/>first part, the theory of automorphic representations, allows the<br/>formulation of comprehensive conjectures and proofs; however,<br/>automorphic representations are abstract. The second part, the theory<br/>of Siegel modular forms, is important for examples and applications; on<br/>the other hand, Siegel modular forms can hide important general<br/>phenomena. By developing the theory of local new- and oldforms for<br/>PGSp(4) this research will make it easier to systematically and<br/>conceptually construct Siegel modular forms from automorphic<br/>representations, and thus may lead to work that draws on the strengths<br/>of both theories.  This research crosses several subdisciplines of<br/>mathematics, and to facilitate this and other work this project will<br/>create a freely accessible database on the World Wide Web about the<br/>existing literature on GSp(4).<br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.049,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,106797.00,106797,4900,"ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM",0400837,,Brooks Roberts,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,brooksr@uidaho.edu,Brooks,Roberts,tbartosz@nsf.gov,Tomek Bartoszynski,7032924885,,07/30/2004,08/01/2004,07/31/2008,Collaborative Research: Local Newforms for GSp(4),Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,,
"0405855<br/>Gao<br/> The PI will study small deviation probabilities for Gaussian processes. In particular, he will look at three specific problems. First, he will study the relationship between small deviations under different norms. This can allow results obtained under one norm to be modified so that they are true under a different norm. Second, he will look at the small deviation probabilities for Gaussian processes with specific forms of the covariance kernel. Finally, he will study the small deviation asymptotic behavior of some Gaussian random fields including the Brownian sheet. The PI believes that some combination of the Karhunen-Loeve expansion, Fourier analysis and geometric methods will allow significant progress to be made on each of these problems.<br/> Stochastic processes move randomly through space and time. Simple descriptions of these processes tell where they should be located as a function of time (the mean process) and what their range should be. Probabilists have studied large deviations (events where the process is far away from where it should be) for many years. Now they are turning to small deviations (events where the range of the process is much smaller than it should be). This research focuses on small deviations for Gaussian processes (processes whose underlying structure is the normal distribution).<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.049,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,84600.00,84600,4900,PROBABILITY,0405855,,Fuchang Gao,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,fuchang@uidaho.edu,Fuchang,Gao,tbartosz@nsf.gov,Tomek Bartoszynski,7032924885,['04000405DB NSF Education & Human Resource'],08/17/2004,08/01/2004,07/31/2008,Small deviation and geometric quantification,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,"['JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PROBABILITY~2006~19~Gao, FC; Li, WBV~10.1007/s10959-006-0026-~535~556~~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=153334947#000242830000001~Logarithmic level comparison for small deviation probabilities~Y~~~~~~', 'TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY~2007~359~Gao, FC; Li, WBV~~1339~1350~~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=153334945#000242237600016~Small ball probabilities for the Slepian Gaussian fields~Y~~~~~~', 'PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY~2005~133~Gao, FC~~1757~1762~~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=144181326#000228798900027~Non-zero boundaries of Leibniz half-spaces~Y~~~~~~', 'PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY~2007~135~Blei, R; Gao, F; Li, WV~~4009~4018~~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=158265411#000249641000029~Metric entropy of high dimensional distributions~Y~~~~~~', 'JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS~2007~98~Gao, F; Wellner, JA~10.1016/j.jmva.2006.09.00~1751~1764~~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=159488379#000251330400004~Entropy estimate for high-dimensional monotonic functions~Y~~~~~~', 'RANDOM STRUCTURES &amp; ALGORITHMS~2005~26~Blei, R; Gao, FC~10.1002/rsa.2005~146~159~~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=143109577#000227134400008~Combinatorial dimension in fractional Cartesian products~Y~~~~~~', 'Electronic Communications in Probability~2008~13~Gao F~~121~~~~Metric entropy k- monotone functions via small deviation~N~~~~~~']",
"The goal of Access STEM in Idaho is to extend the efforts put forth by the Northwest Alliance University of Washington's Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology (DO-IT) project to increase the representation of people with disabilities in STEM academic programs and careers through the following objectives: (a) Recruit high school and college students with disabilities into STEM career paths;(b) Train and Retain students by establishing a mentoring program at the College of Southern Idaho to support and encourage students with disabilities to enroll in STEM careers as they transition from high school to post<br/>secondary education; (c) Recruit and Train STEM faculty at the College of Southern Idaho, to<br/>increase the number of individuals with disabilities in their STEM programs; (d) Train secondary<br/>educators to support and encourage the inclusion of students with disabilities in high school level<br/>STEM courses, and to assist with the facilitation successful transition from high school to<br/>college.<br/>People with disabilities are underrepresented in STEM careers. Further, access to postsecondary education and to the accommodations that facilitate success in college level classes and especially in STEM fields are problematic for youth with disabilities. The lack of access extremely limits the career prospects for individuals with disabilities. The proposed project will utilize research-based curriculum and other resources developed by the Northwest Alliance DO-IT program to effectively change post-secondary outcomes for students with disabilities. Specifically, transition services that guide students toward STEM careers will dramatically increase the number of students in Idaho obtaining post-secondary educations in STEM fields. The implementation of a training program that fosters accessible facilities, activities, and<br/>technologies will greatly improve students' abilities to fully participate in STEM programs.<br/>The building blocks established in Idaho through the Idaho Interagency Council on Secondary Transition are fully incorporated into the design of the proposed project.Each component of the project will be evaluated in relation to the states transition plan which will create a mechanism for sustainability of project activities. In effect, this project lays the foundation for transition services to postsecondary education for all students with disabilities in Idaho. As previously mentioned, the service blue print that will be evaluated through this project will provide other states with an effective transition model.  With Idaho's rural infrastructure, Access STEM in Idaho, along with its many collaborators, will be able to replicate the training and mentoring program in other regions of the state. In collaboration with the Northwest Alliance and the use of their curriculum and training materials, videos, and a searchable Knowledge Base accessed through their project website, a system of statewide support can be established. At the completion of year one, the Access STEM in Idaho will apply for continuation of NSF funds to support a statewide program.

"This project addresses the problem of business survival through spatial or non-spatial (e.g., management and operational) changes in the context of foreign direct investment (FDI) into post-socialist, emerging market countries.  In the case of former socialist transition countries, FDI inflow is primarily from the west for labor and other factor cost advantages, as has been witnessed over the last decade.  The investigators expect that firms should become more efficient in their location choice after experiencing the transition and its effect on their operations and markets, yet adaptive behavior in ex-socialist settings has received minimal attention in the literature.  A model of the adaptation process is proposed that considers the original FDI location as one made with good information about the new market, or one based on inadequate assessment of the conditions that affected the firm's operation.  Either way, a firm can choose a good or bad location, resulting in the possible need for adaptation through management or location change, unless it becomes ""adopted"" by the system.  The decision to stay in place or move to another location will be made on the basis of firm characteristics and options available.  Examples of spatial adaptation through location change may include clustering, or clustering may be a form of adoption where other firms gather around an original FDI company.  To study the adaptation process, this project uses survivors from an earlier NSF study of the original FDI firms from Nordic countries that entered the Baltic region after Soviet collapse in 1991.  It compares adaptation trends and reasons with firm characteristics such as size, source country, host setting, and original location decisions.  Data from the earlier study will be compared with current data for each surviving company.<br/><br/>The project will further basic understanding of adaptive behavior by firms in a new setting.  By selecting survivors who entered the fast-changing and high-risk post-Soviet Baltic region at roughly the same time, the project should help answer some questions about the importance of initial location decisions and the need for location change to survive in the emerging market setting.  The investigators also will be able to determine whether geographic patterns of clustering have developed and if these are viewed as important in the firms' survival strategies.  The longitudinal study of these firms provides a unique opportunity to study survival, adaptation, and change during the first ten years of the transition to market economy.  Because FDI is an important development strategy in transition countries, this project also will provide needed evidence of surviving companies' adaptive strategies and the reasons for needed changes during the first ten years of the transition.  The broader impact of the study could be policies that are better designed to alleviate these problems if governments understand how they affect FDI (and local) firms.<br/><br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.075,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,0.00,104517,4900,Geography and Spatial Sciences,0351558,,Harley E Johansen,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,johansen@uidaho.edu,Harley,Johansen,,Thomas Baerwald,,['04000405DB NSF Education & Human Resource'],03/18/2004,03/01/2004,02/29/2008,"Adaptive Business Location, Survival, and Sustainability in Transitional Market Economies",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,E,"['The Financial Times FDI Magazine~2006~October~Johansen, Harley~~91~~~~""Country Risk and Foreign Direct Investment in Russia and other Transition Countries""~N~~~~~~', 'The Financial Times Magazine FDI~2008~Februar~Harley Johansen~~78~~~~""Private Enterprises Rise from Soviet Ashes""~N~~~~~~']",
"0328827   Cheng   (1) Intellectual merit of the proposed activity<br/>The aim of this investigation is to use dioxygen from air as the oxidizing agent for the destruction of organic pollutants and their surrogates under mild reaction conditions. We have recently discovered a method for the aqueous, room temperature, and atmospheric pressure of dioxygen from air. Such scheme is remarkable in that only air, water, iron particles, and a suitable iron chelation agent are required (Fe(0)/EDTA/O2). No expensive precious metal catalysts are used in the process. This process is a rare instance of abiotic dioxygen activation at room temperature. To our knowledge this is the only instance in which complete degradation of chlorinated organics compounds proceeds with dioxygen as the ultimate oxidant under such mild reaction conditions. We have recently demonstrated this system's oxidizing capabilities on a variety of surrogates including 4-chlorophenol, pentachlorophenol, phenol, nitrobenzene, and malathion. In all cases the starting compounds were degraded into simpler non-toxic carboxylic acids, and carbon dioxide. In this study we intend to examine the mechanism by which this system is able to generate kinetically facile oxidizing species from O2, a study of the reaction pathways through an elemental balance of the products, a survey of the oxidizing capabilities of this system. In terms of a study with both scientific and technical aspects, kinetic studies of the process are also proposed. Variables such as Fe(0) dissolution rate, O2 demand, and EDTA concentration are of interest with the eventual goal of increasing reaction kinetics.<br/>(2) Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity.<br/>There is a significant interest in the discovery of a method for the destruction of organic pollutants under mild reaction conditions with inexpensive reagents. The Fe(0)/EDTA/O2 process fulfills these criteria. Ultimately, it is hoped that this system will lead to the development of field portable organic pollutant destruction schemes that can be rapidly commercialized and used by non-specialized personnel. The Fe(0)/EDTA/O2 process has a strong possibility for scale-up since there are no specialized catalysts or reagents required to activate dioxygen.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,100000.00,100000,4900,EnvE-Environmental Engineering,0328827,,IFrancis F Cheng,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,ifcheng@uidaho.edu,IFrancis,Cheng,,Cynthia J.

"0318801<br/>Miller<br/><br/> The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans has multiple developmental programs, each with a unique set of differentiated cell types that are organized into tissues, organs and higher order structures. Devel-opmental landmarks include spore germination and the establishment of true filamentous hyphae, the ac-quisition of developmental competence (Tc), and the asexual (mitotic) and sexual (meiotic) reproductive cycles. Fundamental processes required for these events include the ability to correctly respond to diverse extrinsic and intercellular signals and to correctly transduce this information to elicit necessary changes in gene expression. In addition, development-specific gene expression must be correctly integrated with al-terations in cell polarity and cell cycle regulation and specialized nuclear movement events.  A. nidulans is a classical model organism for developmental genetics and a representative of a major group of Asco-mycete fungi that include important animal and plant pathogens.  Also included are human pathogens that are increasingly problematic as the population of immunosuppressed persons increases.  Potential out-comes of the work include a comparative approach to understanding how diverse fungal species use con-served regulatory proteins and signaling mechanisms in different ways to control biological processes such as self/non-self recognition at both the cellular and nuclear level, zygote formation (karyogamy) and gametogenesis (meiosis and ascosporogenesis). From a broader perspective, this project's objectives ad-dress mechanistic questions concerning the regulation of cell differentiation and organogenesis, processes that are fundamental developmental events in all complex eucaryotic organisms. <br/>     <br/>Recent studies indicate that the filamentous fungi possess a regulatory network linking signal molecules to cell differentiation events that differs from the budding yeast paradigm.  This is consistent with the more complex life cycle of fungi that form diverse multicellular structures. This project's central hypothe-sis is that a study of organogenesis in A.nidulans will identify new genes and regulatory mechanisms that will provide novel models for eucaryotic multicellular development and reproductive biology. The spe-cific goals of this project are to use a key transcriptional regulator, SterileA, as an entry point into path-ways controlling the initiation of meiotic reproduction and the differentiation of sexual reproductive structures. SteA (Sterile) controls fertilization events and ascogenous tissue development.  steA is con-stiuitively expressed, indicating that SteA interacting proteins control SteA function in response to signal-ing pathways. Interacting proteins will be identified by co-immunoprecipitation of protein complexes (a proteomic approach) and by screening a yeast two-hybrid library expressing A. nidulans developmentally regulated cDNAs.  Specific interactions with MpkB (ERK1 type MAPK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinases will also be tested.  Direct SteA target genes representing the downstream effects of SteA activa-tion, will be identified using chromatin co-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. This class of target genes likely represents key components of the regulatory network controlling foci formation, fertilization and ascogenous tissue differentiation.<br/>     <br/>For over 50 years, A.nidulans has been a valuable tool for teaching classic eucaryotic genetics and, more recently molecular genetics, to young scientists at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels. A project goal is to train productive new scientists.  Therefore, this project includes young scientists at all levels and will provide them with research opportunities and learning experiences in the areas of molecu-lar genetics and cellular and developmental biology. They will also have the opportunity to hone commu-nication skills through daily interactions with other colleagues, and to the larger scientific community, through publications, posters and oral presentations at regional and national meetings. <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,0.00,375000,4900,PLANT FUNGAL & MICROB DEV MECH,0318801,,Bruce L Miller,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,bmiller@uidaho.edu,Bruce,Miller,,Thomas P.

"This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Dr. Thomas Bitterwolf, Chemistry Department, University of Idaho, to study metal bound nitrosyl ligands and their linkage isomers using both frozen matrix methods and time-resolved infrared (IR) techniques. For many years the NO ligand has been known to bind metals through either the nitrogen or oxygen. Recently its ability bind a metal in a side-on fashion has been demonstrated. In addition, time resolved crystallographic and infrared studies have shown that nitrosyl ligands in organometallic and coordination compounds can undergo photochemical linkage isomerizations. This study will build an understanding of the factors that lead to the formation and stabilization of nitrosyl linkage isomers by examining several classes of compounds representing a range of ligand types and electron counts. These include: [CpMn(CO)2NO] cation; [Fe(CO)3NO] anion; salts of Roussin's red, [Fe2(NO)4(S)2] dianion, and black, [Fe3(NO)7(S )] anion; Co(II)(salen)(NO) and Co(II)(acacen)(NO); Fe(S2CNR2)2(NO); and CpM(NO)2X, where M = Cr, Mo or W and X is a variety of anionic species. Frozen organic matrix methods will be used to identify those classes of compounds for which side bonded linkage isomers are formed upon photolysis and time-resolved IR spectroscopy will be used to study the kinetics of relaxation of the linkage isomers back to the terminal nitrosyl form. From these data, the thermodynamic activation parameters will be derived. The final portion of the project will utilize time-resolved IR and other flash kinetics methods to examine several reactions in which side bonded linkage isomers may be involved. <br/><br/>Nitrogen oxide plays a mediating role in intercellular communication, smooth muscle relaxation, and cytotoxic immune response. There is a great interest in identifying compounds that will liberate nitrogen oxide in biological systems. Optimization of these materials requires a more detailed understanding of the mechanism of nitrogen oxide liberation. This study will determine the details of the release of NO groups that are attached to metals. The studies will be carried out in partnership with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. This will give an excellent experience for the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students who work on the project. High school teachers and Native American high school students will be exposed to the project through the PI's participation in the Murdock Foundation Partners in Science Program. <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.049,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,410000.00,410000,4900,SYNTHETIC INORGANIC,0315226,,Thomas E Bitterwolf,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,bitterte@uidaho.edu,Thomas,Bitterwolf,,John Gilje,,,07/08/2003,08/01/2003,07/31/2006,"Photochemical Generation, Kinetics and Chemistry of Transition Metal Nitrosyl Linkage Isomers",Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,E,,

"This project examines the controls on oblique spreading center fault and fracture patterns on the Reykjanes Peninsula in southwest Iceland: one of the few places on Earth where an obliquely-spreading mid-ocean ridge becomes subaerial. The project involves a comprehensive analysis of the structural evolution of an oblique spreading center through close examination of the kinematic history recorded by fault and fracture patterns. The project is also considering theoretical mechanical controls on fracture patterns and is thus applicable to oblique spreading centers worldwide.<br/>Orientations of faults and fractures are directly linked to their ages and length distributions. Furthermore, the stress and kinematic histories evidenced by these fractures are spatially variable across the Reykjanes Peninsula, both as a function of distance along the length of the rift axis and as a function of distance perpendicularly away from it. This implies that the angle of spreading obliquity cannot be the sole control on fault and fracture patterns and evolutionary history at an oblique spreading center. The project is testing the hypothesis that spatial and temporal variability in stress fields and fault/fracture evolution is due to the combined influence of the plate spreading direction, laterally variable magma pressures in the zone of the active volcanism along the rift axis, and local stress perturbations caused by slipping faults and surface monoclinal flexures along the rift margins.<br/>The current project is addressing these controls on oblique spreading center stress fields through a rigorous field analysis of the distribution of fault and fracture orientations, evolutionary history, kinematic indicators, and interpreted stress history across the length and width of the Reykjanes Peninsula. Field observations are being analyzed in the context of spatial relationship to centers of volcanic activity, eruptive history, seismic behavior, and spreading obliquity. Underlying mechanical controls on spatial variations in fault/fracture orientations, fault kinematics, and regional stress history are being examined using 3-D numerical models to address structural characteristics in relation to plate motion obliquity, spatially and temporally variable magmatic activity along the rift axis, and the impact of existing active structures on local stress patterns.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,149429.00,149429,4900,Tectonics,0309016,,Simon A Kattenhorn,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,skattenhorn@alaska.edu,Simon,Kattenhorn,,David Fountain,,,06/17/2003,07/01/2003,06/30/2006,"Tectonic Versus Magmatic Controls on Stress Field Characteristics, Fracture Patterns, and Fault Evolution at an Oblique Spreading Center",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,A,,

"This CAREER project addresses optical properties/interactions and phonon dynamics of wide band gap semiconductor nanostructures capable of light emission in the UV range utilizing Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Wide bandgap semiconductors to be investigated include GaN, AlN, and AlGaN alloys, as well as ZnO, and SiC. Research issues concerning light emission, crystal structure and crystal symmetry characteristics of nano-particles, quantum-dots, and random-structured powders will be studied. The approach includes the study of properties of individual nanocrystals as well as ensembles of particles to explore the basic mechanisms of light emission properties such as spectral range and efficiency inherent to a confined structure of a given size and shape, as well as the impact of the cluster environment. Additionally, energy re-laxation channels which occur via crystal vibrational modes--electron-phonon interactions, will be investigated to assess the impact of confined phonons on optical characteristics of particles. Year 1 of the project is focused on investigation of optical and material properties of nano-structures of SiC, GaN, AlN, ZnO, to lay the foundation for the study of more complicated mixed particle systems in the following years. Years 2 and 3 will focus on studies concerning the optical properties of particle ensembles and clusters and on establishing a novel UV-optical spectroscopy setup for remote excitation to enable studies concerning phenomena of light interactions, energy transfer, exciton diffusion, and efficiency losses among nano-particles. Years 4 and 5 will focus on resonant Raman scattering studies, as well as research involving the optical and structural behavior of nanostructures under high-pressure, high-temperature conditions. <br/>%%% <br/>The project addresses fundamental materials science research issues having technological relevance. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, and the integration of research and education. In tandem with the research program, new interdisciplinary curricula will be developed including a new course on optical materials and devices and a new undergraduate degree program on the Science of Materials. The course curriculum will be designed for upper level undergraduate students as well as for graduate students from various science disciplines. This program will focus on a broad spectrum of issues related to materials science, physics, and the chemistry of materials from the large scale to the molecular level. The impact of the proposed research will be to contribute towards basic knowledge of the structural and optical characteristics of nanocrystallites, a key to engineering viable optical devices operating in the UV. The new curricula, together with the active promotion of student participation in experimental research, is expected to have broad impact on the educational development of students and in the longer term contribute to both high technology industry and academia.<br/>*** <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.049,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,393626.00,393626,4900,ELECTRONIC/PHOTONIC MATERIALS,0238845,,Leah Bergman,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,lbergman@uidaho.edu,Leah,Bergman,,LaVerne D.

"0233583<br/>Aizen<br/>  The evaluation of the long-term dynamics of water cycle components in the World's largest closed drainage system has not been examined in detail. Location of the Tien Shan and rich data provide a unique opportunity to assess the pathways of water among hydrological surface and subsurface reservoirs and to quantify the precipitation partitioning among land surface stores with different residence times. The main objective of our research is estimating, simulating, and predicting the variability in water cycle components and water composition in the Central Asian alpine basins. This project proposes to: (1) Provide background information and evaluate the long-term changes in type and quantity of precipitation, evaporation, total river runoff and snow/glacier/permafrost runoff, major ions, pH, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen. This data will be posted at the University of Idaho web site (www.mines.uidaho.edu/~aizen/aizen.html). (2) Discover the controls on the water chemistry (changes in glacier, snow, and permafrost river runoff, atmospheric deposition, rock weathering, etc.). Define the input/output chemical budget emphasizing on the watershed geology. (3) Implement modular-design, deterministic, distributed-parameter modeling systems:  i.e., ""Precipitation Runoff Modeling System"" and/or snow-ice simulation with ""Snowmelt Runoff Model"" in application with the operational runoff modeling, which simulates active layer freezing and thawing. Geochemical modeling includes specification of the various elements and determination of saturation indices for various metals based on MINTEQA2 and WATEQ. Mass-balance calculations will be facilitated by computer codes such as BALANCE, NETPATH and PHREEQE. Validation of simulation results will be based on data sets other than those used in model calibration. (4) Develop and validate the transition from small hydrological units to complex geographical systems through the scaling relationships and to determine the distribution of point measurements. Three representative sub-basins will be used to determine water balances using data during each time step (daily, monthly, seasonally, and annually). (5) Apply climate scenarios to assess the climate-driven impact on future water resources and model the effect of global warming on water chemistry. <br/>    The basis of this integrative research is the collaboration with the Central Asian, the USA, the Japan, and the Chinese institutions.<br/><br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,380000.00,380000,4900,BE: NON-ANNOUNCEMENT RESEARCH,0233583,,Vladimir B Aizen,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,aizen@uidaho.edu,Vladimir,Aizen,,L.

"ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Recent stratigraphic and isotopic studies reveal a more complex nature to Carboniferous<br/>glaciation than previously considered, and highlight a need for further study of the timing and mode of initiation of Gondwanan glaciation, and its mechanistic link to eustatic fluctuations, changes in continental weathering rates, and paleoceanographic and climatic conditions.<br/>Furthermore, some isotopic proxy data suggest that the mid-Carboniferous (Chesterian) may even have been a time of global warming and deglaciation between glacial episodes. We hypothesize that the changes in sea level, continental weathering patterns, and oceanographic and paleoclimatic conditions that would have accompanied the significant change in ice-sheet dynamics associated with either onset of main-stage glaciation or potentially intermittent<br/>deglaciation during the Late Mississippian should be recorded in the stratigraphy and isotopic compositions of Chesterian strata. We further hypothesize that each of the two aforementioned scenarios would have imparted, on Chesterian deposits, a unique set of stratigraphic and<br/>geochemical signatures that can be used to place quantitative constraints on the hypothesized evolutionary paths of Gondwanan glaciation.<br/>In order to test these hypotheses, we propose to carry out an integrated, high-resolution cycle- and sequence-stratigraphic, and isotopic study of Chesterian carbonates and siliciclastics from east-central Idaho and southwestern Montana focused on developing a record of environmental change during the Chesterian in this portion of Panthalassa. A detailed regional reassessment of the Chesterian macrofossil and microfossil biostratigraphy will be made from proximal and distal settings of the study area in order to maximize the resolution of chronostratigraphic correlation in the proposed sequence stratigraphic framework. We will carry out a hierarchical sequence stratigraphic analysis of the Chesterian rocks in order to decipher their depositional history, and to determine the nature and distribution of peritidal and subtidal parasequences, major sequence-bounding unconformities and parasequence boundaries at a local- and regional-scale. This will allow for evaluation of how the parasequences and surfaces relate to subtle tectonic movements or record eustatic fluctuations. Paleontologic analysis will provide important qualitative and quantitative constraints on the amount of relative sea level rise and/or fall recorded in each parasequence or sequence. We propose to build on the recently derived set of stable and radiogenic isotope curves for the Carboniferous by developing a set of integrated stable (d13C, d18O, and d34S) and radiogenic (87Sr/86Sr) isotope records for the Chesterian that should contribute uniquely by: (1) refining a portion of the existing isotope curves, (2) defining a coupled d13Ccarb and d13Corg record, and (2) testing the potential for reconstructing O and C isotope vertical gradients for the Antler foreland basin.<br/>By developing a series of high-resolution proxies from the same set of chronostratigraphically well-constrained deposits, we will be able to evaluate the relative rates and phase (i.e., lead-lag) relationships of the stratigraphic and isotopic proxy records, an aspect that has been variably compromised in previous intrabasinal studies. This approach should allow for differentiation of long-term tectonic events from higher frequency eustatic events in this basin, and thus provide considerable insight into the role of tectonic forcing on the stratigraphic and isotopic character of the Chesterian strata.

Moreover, we anticipate that this study should quantitatively constrain the spectrum of environmental changes that occurred during the Chesterian in this portion of Panthalassa, including global paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic perturbations.

"The atmosphere over the Antarctic Plateau plays a unique role in the global climate system. It is the coldest and driest atmosphere on earth, and radiation processes dominate both the surface and the top-of-atmosphere energy budgets.  In summer, the four radiation components (downward and upward, shortwave and longwave) are each in the range of 100 to 400 watts per square meter, generally exceeding the sensible and latent heat fluxes by at least an order of magnitude. In winter, there is no shortwave radiation, so the downward and upward longwave fluxes are the dominant contributors to the surface energy budget. When spectrally resolved, longwave radiation is also useful for remote sensing of atmospheric and surface properties.  Thus it is desirable to develop methods for remote sensing by polar-orbiting satellites so that the entire continent can be characterized. Surface-based observations are invaluable for validating satellite observations, as well as for obtaining information about climatic processes that are best studied in situ.  <br/>Five separate projects will be based upon analysis of data from South Pole Atmospheric Radiation and Cloud Lidar Experiment (SPARCLE), a full-year experiment of the effects of clouds, water vapor, atmospheric ice crystals, and surface snow, on the longwave radiation spectrum measured at the surface.   Project 1 will use the climatological database of longwave spectra to determine the contributions of different gases to the downward longwave flux at the surface and the surface cloud radiative forcing.  Project 2 involves longwave radiative properties of Antarctic clouds and their effects on the surface and atmospheric energy budgets.  Project 3 involves the measurement of humidity profiles and development of retrieval algorithms of boundary-layer temperature and humidity profiles for Antarctica.  Project 4 involves the simultaneous retrieval of the surface temperature and the spectral emissivity of snow.  Project 5 is a study of near-surface atmospheric temperature profiles. <br/>The experimental data and the subsequent analysis products are expected to generate research in other areas, including remote sensing, climate modeling, and weather forecasting in Antarctica for potential year-round logistical operations. The data analysis projects proposed here will also provide data from the Antarctic Plateau useful in constraining and testing general circulation models.<br/>*** <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.078,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,97657.00,97657,4900,ANT Ocean & Atmos Sciences,0230114,,Von P Walden,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,v.walden@wsu.edu,Von,Walden,,Kelly Falkner,,['0100CYXXDB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],12/17/2002,01/01/2003,12/31/2006,Longwave Radiation Processes over the Antarctic Plateau,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,P,,
"Wood<br/>0229495<br/><br/>There is debate in the scientific literature as to the extent to which the platinum-group elements (PGE, e.g., platinum, palladium, iridium) can be transported and concentrated by hydrothermal fluids to form ore deposits. The debate is hampered by a lack of experimental data with which to test the hypothesis that hydrothermal processes play a role in the concentration of the PGE to economic levels. To redress this lack of data, a series of experiments will be conducted. Some of these experiments will attempt to determine the relative solubilities of palladium, platinum, and iridium in hydrothermal solutions of geological relevance. Other experiments will be conducted to simulate the effect of hydrothermal fluids on magnesium-rich; PGE-bearing rocks similar to those in many PGE occurrences. The latter experiments will attempt to directly model hydrothermal processes that have occurred in the Marathon copper-palladium deposit in the Coldwell Complex, Ontario. The mineral assemblages and conditions employed in the latter experiments will be based on concurrent field-based research on the deposit being conducted by colleagues at the University of Windsor (I.M. Samson, B.J. Fryer) and the University of Waterloo (R. Linnen). A postdoctoral fellow, an undergraduate student, and a graduate student will participate in the project and will be trained in aqueous geochemistry. Both will be encouraged to present their work at national scientific meetings, and the postdoctoral fellow will participate in teaching of undergraduate geochemistry. The project will strengthen and expand existing collaboration between the PI and Canadian colleagues. The results of this research will be of direct socioeconomic benefit via the development of improved exploration models for PGE deposits.

"Geist<br/>EAR-0207605<br/><br/>Floreana Island is the most distinctive volcano of the Galapagos hotspot system. Unlike other Galapagos Islands, Floreana experienced extensive explosive activity, and its alkalic lavas are anomalously enriched in incompatible trace elements, exhibit evidence of metasomatism, have unique isotopic compositions, and contain abundant mantle xenoliths. The fundamental goal of the proposed project is to use Floreana's unique features to elucidate the magmatic processes that construct and modify the lithosphere forming the Galapagos Platform, which will be accomplished through a detailed volcanologic, petrologic, and geochemical study.  Determining the volcanic history and compositional evolution of Floreana volcano will permit estimation of variations in the depths and extents of melt production through analysis of major and trace element variations and how those change with time. These results will be applied to questions about Floreana's volcanic evolution, including: a) the relationship between the different eruptive sequences; b) apparent shallow depths of melting, which may contradict a deep plume origin; c) compositional variations within single eruptive episodes; d) the relationship between Floreana lavas and the giant volcanic terraces which underlie the southern Galapagos Platform; and e) the origins of the xenoliths and their relationship to Floreana lavas and other parts of the Galapagos lithosphere. The powerful combination of high precision geochemical and petrologic analysis coupled with detailed field observations will provide a rare opportunity to gain insight into elusive questions about plume-lithosphere interaction, ocean-island magmatism, and, ultimately, mantle evolution. <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,54474.00,54474,4900,Petrology and Geochemistry,0207605,,Dennis J Geist,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,dgeist@uidaho.edu,Dennis,Geist,,Sonia Esperanca,,,07/11/2002,12/01/2002,11/30/2006,"Collaborative Research: The Origin and Evolution of the Galapagos Lithosphere, Floreana Volcano",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,J,,
"0225421<br/>Oldow<br/><br/>The GEOscience Network (GEON) project seeks to bring leading-edge information management research to bear on creating a cyberinfrastructure for the solid earth geosciences to interlink multidisciplinary geoscience data sets in 4D space.  The need to manage the growing amounts of diverse Earth science data has been recognized through a series of NSF-sponsored community meetings on Geoinformatics.  The GEON collaboration between IT researchers, who represent key technology areas relevant to GEON, and Earth science researchers, who represent a broad cross section of Earth science sub-disciplines, will provide the foundation for a national Geoinformatics program.<br/><br/>There is a pressing need in the Earth sciences for a national information infrastructure that enables the community to share databases and tools to enable interdisciplinary analysis of networked data sets in studying a wide range of phenomena including the interplay between tectonics and the evolution of sedimentary basins;  the role of mountain building in the evolution of climate and life;  broader predictive understanding and modeling capabilities of geologic hazards, such as earthquakes and volcanoes;  the 4D reconstruction of  the Earth through time;  and, managing the natural resources of our planet. Each of these problems requires interdisciplinary research to discover relationships among Earth science disciplines, and depends on the community's ability to construct an integrated geoscience information system.  The goal of GEON is to develop the necessary IT foundations and create such a system.<br/><br/>Many past and on-going projects in the geosciences have produced valuable sub-disciplinary and disciplinary databases.  Numerous national centers and organizations such as IRIS, UNAVCO, the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), the Southern California Earthquake Center  (SCEC), as well as government agencies such as the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), are contributing research and data to the community.  Building on this base, the imperative now is to take a step beyond research resulting in disciplinary databases, towards a new paradigm for interdisciplinary information integration and tool sharing via the creation of the GEON cyberinfrastructure.  The research products and services arising from GEON will be available to the entire scientific community and will transform the way in which geoscience research is conducted, opening unprecedented avenues for research and collaboration and providing the foundation for creating geoscience collaboratories.<br/>***<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,0.00,399564,4900,ITR LARGE GRANTS,0225421,,John S Oldow,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,oldow@utdallas.edu,John,Oldow,,Leonard E.

"McClelland<br/>EAR-0208162<br/><br/>Modern examples of volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VMS) deposits suggest that hydrothermal activity associated with formation of these deposits is a steady-state process. In contrast, ancient examples typically define distinct age groups and recent genetic models relate VMS mineralization to specific tectonic events such as incipient intra-arc rifting. Distinction between steady state and punctual models for VMS mineralization requires high precision geochronologic data to establish the duration of magmatism at the scale of individual deposits and to establish correlation, distinction, or migration of magmatism observed at the regional scale. The widespread occurrence of Devonian to Mississippian VMS deposits in the northern North American Cordillera provides an ideal setting to examine this issue. U-Pb geochronology and Nd-Sr isotope geochemistry combined with major, trace, and REE geochemistry of felsic and mafic rocks associated with mineralization and hydrothermal alteration will establish the age and tectonic setting of VMS mineralization in the Ambler district, southern Brooks Range, Alaska. The resulting database will serve as a basis for comparison with and evaluation of broadly age equivalent VMS deposits in the Yukon-Tanana terrane as well as sediment-hosted deposits within adjacent terranes and the Cordilleran miogeocline. The results of this project will provide valuable insight into the temporal and tectonic setting of VMS mineralization throughout the northern Cordillera. This insight will potentially lead to the generation of new genetic models for the evolution and preservation of VMS deposits in additional settings. The project will also address the long-standing question of the tectonic setting of mid-Paleozoic magmatism in the Cordillera. <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,131293.00,131293,4900,Petrology and Geochemistry,0208162,,William McClelland,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,bill-mcclelland@uiowa.edu,William,McClelland,,Sonia Esperanca,,['04000203DB NSF Education & Human Resource'],07/20/2002,07/01/2002,06/30/2005,"Age and Lithogeochemistry of Volcanic-hosted Massive Sulfide Deposits of the Ambler District, Southern Brooks Range, Alaska",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,,
"One of the major recent advances in reconstructing past plate configurations was the recognition that the Precordillera Terrane of Argentina was derived (rifted from) the Ouachita embayment of present day North America, thus providing a rare example of knowing exactly where an exotic terrane came from. However, the timing of the rifting and the timing of the subsequent collision with Gondwana, critical to Paleozoic reconstructions is problematic. Previously the timing of the collision was thought to Middle to Late Ordovician based on when the carbonate platform drowned, presumably by close approach and subduction of the continental margin. However, more recent work suggests that the drowning of the carbonate platform was due to rift-related subsidence, and if correct, dates the rifting from North America, not the subsequent collision with Gondwana. This project aims to date the collision by radiometric methods from rocks in the exposed suture zone, including magmatic bodies that intruded during and after the several phases or pulses of collision-related deformation. Results will clarify the arrival time of the Precordillera, data that will be critical in establishing a Paleozoic plate position history.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,149720.00,149720,4900,Tectonics,0126299,,William McClelland,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,bill-mcclelland@uiowa.edu,William,McClelland,,Stephen Harlan,,,04/18/2002,05/01/2002,04/30/2005,"Collaborative Research: Kinematics and Timing of Early Paleozoic Tectonic Events In the Easternmost Precordillera Terrane, Argentina:An Evaluation of Gondwana-Laurentia Interaction",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,,

"The increasing involvement of stakeholder groups in solving spatial decision problems has created a need for information technology capable of supporting collaborative spatial decision making.  The goal of this project is to develop a better understanding of how groups of stakeholders may use geospatial technology to enhance collaborative approach to problem solving and decision making.  Such knowledge is necessary in order to develop geospatial technology support tools capable of accommodating diverse participants involved in solving location-based decision problems.  This project will use a field experiment approach to study the dynamics of collaborative work and decision making supported by geospatial information technology.  The experiment will involve true stakeholders invited to engage in a realistic decision problem of water management planning in the Boise River basin in southwestern Idaho.  Two groups each with 10 participants will be used: the control group will be exposed only to traditional support tools such as traditional maps, whereas the experimental group will be exposed to collaborative decision support tools such as geographic information system (GIS) -based maps and three-dimensional visualizations.  The human-computer-human interaction process during the experiment will be captured using professional video cameras.  A tested social-behavioral science technique called ""interaction coding"" will be employed to compile data logs from the experiment and exploratory sequential data analysis techniques will be used to analyze the data.  Parametric and non-parametric statistical procedures will be used to test a number of research hypotheses. <br/><br/>Dealing with location-based decision problems in an open manner is becoming more important as stakeholder participation increases in land use, natural resource, and environmental decision making.  The primary rationale for enhanced stakeholder participation in environmental decision making is based on the democratic maxim that those affected by a decision should participate directly in the decision making process.  The project results are expected to expand knowledge about the impacts of geospatial information technology on collaborative decision processes engaging diverse groups of stakeholders.

Further, there is a growing consensus that the lack of trained information security an information assurance personnel has reached or soon will reach crisis proportions.  This REU is intended to address the shortage of information assurance researchers by providing opportunities for undergraduates to participate in ongoing research projects under the auspices of the CSDS.  The Center for Secure and Dependable Software (CSDS) at the University of Idaho (UI) was formed in 1998 as an Idaho Center to better organize and promote information security education and research.  The CSDS/University of Idaho was named as one of the first seven Centers of Excellence in Information Assurance Education, and is therefore uniquely suited to lead this initiative.<br/><br/> Our specific objectives are to include 14 undergraduate REU participants yearly (42 total) in a program, which is intended:<br/><br/>1. To address the national need for researchers and ""thinkers"" with competencies in critical infrastructure protection by involving undergraduates in this area of research.<br/>2. To provide an ""learn by doing"" environment in which motivated undergraduates learn how to take charge of their research in a disciplined and creative manner, and to lead others in such endeavors.<br/>3. To offer a unique research experiences to people who would not otherwise have such opportunities.<br/>4. To stimulate undergraduates to pursue graduate education or research careers in information assurance.<br/>5. To attract a diverse student population to this field of study.<br/>6. To provoke discussion and consideration of the vast array of ethical issues involved in computer security and privacy research and practice, both for the REU participants and later at her REU participants' home site.<br/><br/>Key components of our program include: a faculty with considerable experience in working with undergraduates in a research environment; immediate integration of students in existing research programs in information assurance, drawn from the PI and senior investigator's currently funded research: an emphasis on critical thinking, leadership, presentation, and publication skills; the Expanding Horizons seminars, which bring students into direct contact with highly regarded members of the information assurance field, with practitioners, and  with those involved in setting national policy in this area; also an optional ethics component in the form of an integrated sequence of lectures and discussion sections to be led by senior investigators with considerable expertise in this area.  A service aspect is also included, where students lead a project of their choice to solve specific real problems in information assurance.<br/><br/>The program is geared towards students who would not normally have an opportunity to work in research or in this area.  Recruitment will emphasize diversity, both to enrich the student experience and to bring underrepresented groups in the national security/privacy/information assurance policy and technology debates.  Ongoing assessment is emphasized in terms both of examining how student capabilities change through their participation in this program as well as in tracking student career choices after the program ends.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.070,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,264171.00,264171,4900,WORKFORCE,0097858,,Deborah Frincke,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,frincke@cs.uidaho.edu,Deborah,Frincke,,Harriet Taylor,,,06/15/2001,06/01/2001,12/31/2004,REU Site:  Developing Undergraduate Research in Computer Network-Based Intrusion Detection and Information System Protection,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Jim Alves-Foss'],,,
"This award provides funding for a 3-year summer REU site in Environmental Research at the University of Idaho, under the direction of Dr. Margrit von Braun.  This site will provide a challenging summer experience conducting environmental restoration and remediation research for a diverse group of 10 undergraduate students who have limited opportunities to conduct research at their home institutions and who are primarily underrepresented in science and engineering.  Working closely with a faculty mentor the students will work on individual research projects with topics such as phyto-and bioremediation, supercritical fluid extraction of mixed waste, biologically engineered treatment systems, aqueous geochemistry, and watershed restoration.

"Geist<br/>EAR-0003367<br/><br/>Whereas many volcanoes erupt magmas of diverse composition over a wide range of temperatures, others erupt magmas of nearly identical composition over a narrow range of temperature.  One or more magmatic processes must buffer the compositions in the latter type of system as the magmas ascend through the lithosphere, and determining and quantifying those processes are the objectives of this proposal. Because the processes involved in buffering cause little variability in whole rock compositions, the main means of the study will be electron and ion microprobe analysis of rehomogenized melt inclusions. Much of this study, and many others, depends on the presumption that melt inclusions reliably reflect the compositional evolution of the magma. To test this presumption, a series of experiments has been designed to assess the degree that inclusions' compositions are reliable.  Growing crystals change the compositions of the liquid in a boundary layer whose thickness depends on the diffusivity of the chemical constituents and the growth rate of the crystal.  The effect of a compositional boundary layer on the composition of melt inclusions will be simulated by creating artificial melt inclusions by annealing a pre-fractured crystal in the presence of a melt with which it is in equilibrium.  Boundary layers of different thicknesses should be generated by a range of cooling rates and different amounts of total cooling.<br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,83919.00,83919,4900,Petrology and Geochemistry,0003367,,Dennis J Geist,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,dgeist@uidaho.edu,Dennis,Geist,,Sonia Esperanca,,['01000102DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],12/07/2000,06/01/2001,11/30/2005,Compositional Buffering of Magmas as an Indicator of Magmatic Processes,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,J,,

"0099444<br/>Machleidt<br/>Phenomenological nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials, based on meson exchange, provide a high-precision description of the NN scattering data.  A drawback of these potentials is that they are not derived from the fundamental theory of the strong interaction, QCD.  The symmetries of QCD are retained in a low energy effective field theory termed chiral perturbation theory.  The chiral NN potentials so derived do not, as yet, provide such a quantitative fit, nor are they suited for microscopic nuclear structure theory. The Principal Investigator has experience with the development of potentials that provide a high quality fit.  The proposal contains a plan for continuing development of the chiral NN potentials until they give a high-precision fit to the data.  An accurate chiral NN potential will have substantial impact on exact few-nucleon studies and microscopic nuclear many-body theory.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.049,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,141000.00,141000,4900,NUCLEAR THEORY,0099444,,Ruprecht Machleidt,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,machleid@uidaho.edu,Ruprecht,Machleidt,,Bradley D.

To facilitate the implementation, we are developing curriculum materials on both the PDM process and on appropriate pedagogy delivered using the web. To facilitate best-practice pedagogy, our team includes a master educator from the college of education. This project is providing knowledge of (1) the value of teaching a global problem solving method across a curriculum, (2) pedagogy for teaching problem solving to diverse and developing learners, (3) methods for facilitating teaching of a common problem solving approach, and (4) methods for vertically integrating a curriculum.<br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.076,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,199926.00,199926,4900,CCLI-ADAPTATION AND IMPLEMENTA,0088591,,Donald F Elger,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,delger@uidaho.edu,Donald,Elger,,Russell L.

"Molecular advances have made it possible to study wildlife populations by extracting and analyzing DNA from shed material such as hair or scat and from museum specimens.  The familiar forensic practice of DNA fingerprinting can be used on samples of hair or scat to 'capture,' count and track individuals without ever handling or observing them.  Unfortunately, these materials contain low quantities of DNA that introduce sporadic errors and inaccuracies into genetic data.  Errors also occur when multiple individuals share the same DNA fingerprint or when one clump of hair, in fact, contains hair from two individuals.  In this project, a set of statistical methods will be developed to assess the probability that a given sample contains each of the different possible errors.  This leads to an efficient strategy for finding and removing errors by focusing further data acquisition on the most unreliable samples.  Finally, the statistical framework will be packaged into a computer program and be made available to all researchers via the internet.<br/><br/>Forensic, non-invasive and historical genetic information on wild populations can be used to address questions that are impractical or impossible to address by non-genetic methods.  This research project will make a major contribution to accessing this type of information because it directly addresses two issues of paramount importance, accuracy and efficiency.  But just as with forensic DNA evidence in a court of law, this information must be reliable for the conclusions to be accurate.  Because collecting genetic information is also expensive, its acquisition must be efficient.  <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,166000.00,166000,4900,POPULATION DYNAMICS,0089756,,Lisette P Waits,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,lwaits@uidaho.edu,Lisette,Waits,sscheine@nsf.gov,Samuel Scheiner,7032927175,['01000102DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],01/17/2001,02/01/2001,12/31/2004,"An Integrative Statistical Framework for Assessing and Minimizing Errors in Ancient, Non-invasive and Forensic Genetic Studies",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Paul Joyce'],P,,
"0094635<br/>Hartzell<br/><br/>Studies of the soil-dwelling bacterium Myxococcus xanthus have broadened our understanding of prokaryotic biology.  M. xanthus uses gliding motility to forage for nutrients in relatively dry environments and to form a fruiting body containing quiescent spores in the absence of nutrients.  We have discovered independent sets of genes encoding homologs of the E. coli transmembrane TolBQRA protein complex that are essential for gliding motility during growth.  Surprisingly, the Tol proteins are not needed for gliding per se during development, because disruption of any of the tol genes does not affect aggregation or fruiting body formation.  However, the spores produced by tol mutants fail to mature, showing that the Tol proteins are required at a late stage of spore differentiation.  We will test the hypothesis that the Tol proteins are involved in the transport of biopolymers needed for gliding motility during growth and spore maturation during development.  <br/><br/>Important clues to the function of the Tol complex have come from the study of one tol operon, the gidA- aglU (tolB1) operon.  AglU, a homolog of TolB, is predicted to be an outer membrane lipoprotein.  Like TolB, AglU contains WD-repeat motifs that form B-propellar structures that mediate protein-protein interactions with the TolQRA proteins located in the inner membrane.  The gidA gene encodes a homolog of the E. coli glucose-inhibited division protein, a protein of unknown function present in many prokaryotes.  Purified M. xanthus GidA absorbs at 450nm and has features showing that it is a flavoprotein. The gidA mutant does not aggregate and cells do not differentiate into spores.  Moreover, the gidA mutant releases a substance that inhibits the development of wild-type cells.  The inhibitor is likely exported via the Tol complex, because a second mutation in aglU prevents the release of this toxic substance.  Analysis of the inhibitor, purified from the gidA mutant, may provide clues to the nature of the material secreted through the Tol complex. <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,363222.00,373222,4900,Genetic Mechanisms,0094635,,Patricia L Hartzell,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,hartzell@uidaho.edu,Patricia,Hartzell,,Patrick P.

"Recommended project is for an integrated marine field and laboratory investigation of the western end of the Galapagos archipelago, with a focus on studying lavas from the submarine western flanks of Fernandina and Cerro Azul volcanoes after mapping them with camera tows and multibeam and side scan sonar.  The goal is to define and then sample volcanic products from the leading edge of Galapagos plume, with associated, extensive geochemical and petrological studies that will help define the nature of the Galapagos plume.  These samples will be used to test whether magma chemistry from leading-edge plume volcanism indeed best reflects the chemistry of the plume mantle source, whether high 3He/4He does indeed reflect undegassed, deep mantle sources, and also to test whether the unique horseshoe-shaped pattern of Galapagos geochemical variation is due to mantle zonation or is instead related to other geologic processes.  The field mapping will determine whether there is a new submarine volcano westward of Fernandina that represents the actual plume leading edge (such as represented by Loihi in the Hawaiian plume volcanism), as suggested by seismic data.

"Wood<br/>EAR-0087065<br/><br/>Tungsten is a metal of strategic importance. Reliable thermodynamic data with which to calculate the solubilities of the most important tungsten ores, scheelite (CaWO4) and ferberite (FeWO4), and the mass transfer of tungsten, in hydrothermal solutions are generally not available. Yet, such data are required to develop comprehensive genetic models of hydrothermal tungsten deposits; these models can guide exploration for new tungsten resources. A study is therefore proposed in which the solubilities of scheelite and ferberite will be measured in non-complexing solutions at saturated water vapor pressure as a function of temperature from 50 degrees to 290 degrees C, pH and ionic strength. The pH will be monitored directly in-situ using a hydrogen electrode concentration cell (HECC) of the type developed and used successfully at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. From the solubilities measured as a function of pH and ionic strength, the solubility products for scheelite and ferberite, and the dissociation constants for tungstic acid (H2WO40), all of which are essential thermodynamic data for the calculation of W mass transfer, can be derived. The project will involve one Ph.D. student who will be trained in hydrothermal geochemistry and high-pressure/high-temperature experimental methods.

"This NSF supported project involves a multi-disciplinary team who will develop new manufacturing methods to improve the functionality of dental implants.  The goal of this project is to produce dental implants through new powder processing technologies to create functionally graded materials that can be biologically bonded to the human bone.  Specifically, the objectives are two-fold:  (1) to develop net shape/near net shape Ti implants of dense core with surface porosity that are coated with biocompatible hydroxyapatite (HAp) coating and  (2) to characterize the implants in terms of mechanical properties and biocompatibility.  The hypothesis is that bone re-growth will be promoted by the pores in the Ti that support the penetration of the HAp coating deeply into the substrate.  The dense Ti core will maintain the overall strength.  An innovative processing technique will be used to create an inverted porosity in Ti.  Thick films of HAp will be deposited on Ti using an electrodeposition technique.  The coatings will be characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques.  Mechanical property evaluations such as hardness, fracture strength, and adhesion will be performed to examine the quality of the as-coated implants. In vitro testing in simulated body fluids will be carried out to evaluate its bioactivity. The surface characteristics of the implant in simulated fluid will be studied in situ by an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope.<br/> <br/>The participation of  local high school students will be one of the outreach activities of this project that will introduce them to the Biomedical Engineering field.

"These research projects fall within the areas of mathematical population genetics and interacting particle systems. The unifying thrust is the study of mathematical models of biological systems at the population level. The interplay between various genetic influences such as mutation, selection, and population structure can sometimes confound one's ability to draw valid inference. The first goal is to develop methods of estimation and inference for complex molecular genetic data arising from populations with various kinds of structure. The investigators explore sampling distributions and likelihood methods in the presence of these confounding effects. The second goal involves the study of genealogical processes (i.e., coalescent theory) for populations which are subject to various selective forces, geographical segregation, or other hierarchical structuring. Both sampling theory and coalescent methods provide a framework for computational methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Importance Sampling. The third goal is to study spatial interactions which arise in ecology and epidemiology using interacting particle systems. The problems addressed include several new nonlinear voter models with a cluster-breaking feature and new work on the two-stage contact process, with applications to metapopulation models.<br/> Previous models of the ecology and genetics of natural populations have been based on many simplifying assumptions. It is now important to produce more realistic models to address ecological and evolutionary problems that impact society. In addition to the inherent randomness in real biological systems, spatial structure is often of critical importance. Examples of these problems include the evolution and spread of infectious diseases, invasions of exotic species, and survival of species in fragmented habitats. Furthermore, the technical revolution in gene sequencing is producing huge data sets that can only be deciphered in a sophisticated mathematical framework. The new field of bioinformatics relies heavily on an evolutionary perspective. This interdisciplinary work is part of an ongoing effort to develop and employ new mathematical methods for the purpose of addressing these complex biological problems at the population level. <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.049,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,165608.00,165608,4900,POPULATION DYNAMICS,0072198,,Paul Joyce,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,joyce@uidaho.edu,Paul,Joyce,,K Crank,,,07/31/2000,08/01/2000,07/31/2004,Stochastic Models in Population Genetics and Ecology,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Stephen Krone'],,,
"9985194  Boll  Successful watershed restoration requires an understanding of the complex interaction between climate, land use, hydrology, water quality, ecology and the human behavioral and economic considerations of those living in and interacting with the environment.  In individual watersheds, landowners, municipalities, state and federal agencies are seeking information and tools to evaluate the effectiveness of efforts to improve water quality.  At the research level, tools and models are being developed to represent more accurately a region's water and pollutant transport processes, but applications to situations having a significant impact are limited.  The purpose of this grant is to  better educate future hydrology and water quality experts and those individuals needing to improve water quality, and to gain a better understanding of water and pollutant transport in the watersheds of the Northwest Wheat  and Range Region (NWRR) in the Pacific Northwest.

One fundamental assumption has been that tectonic transport directions parallel mineral or extension lineation directions, however three-dimensional numeric modeling of shear zones indicates that this is not always a valid assumption.  This project will address this issue using the western Idaho shear zone that marks the accretion of allochthonous terranes to the west to the north American plate during the Late Cretaceous.  The kinematic and geologic data have resulted in several, disparate models for this accretion.  This study is an integrated structural, microstructural and U/Pb geochronologic project designed to determine the kinematic history of the late Cretaceous western Idaho shear zone that will employ three-dimensional techniques to test the validity of the assumption that tectonic transport is parallel to lineation.

"Considerable attention has focused in recent years on research examining interactions between the atmosphere and tropical oceans, particularly the Pacific, where the El Nino/Southern Oscillation originates.  Related research has examined how temperature fluctuations in tropical waters affect climatic variability around the globe.  Far less attention has been given to the dynamics and climatic consequences of comparable ocean-atmosphere interactions in mid- and high-latitude seas.  This study examines spatial teleconnection patterns and temporal oscillatory characteristics, especially at decadal time scales, of the associations between sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and winter snow accumulation in Russia.  The motivation for this study is recently revealed evidence that a large share of land-surface warming can be attributed to decadal and longer time scale-variations in sea-surface temperatures.  A combination of advanced statistical methods will be used to analyze historical snow-depth records for Russia in combination with records of Atlantic and Pacific SSTs.  Statistical approaches to be used include principal component analysis, singular spectrum analysis, multi-channel singular spectrum analysis, and singular value decomposition analysis.  This study will identify geographic regions and time scales of teleconnections between Russian snow depth and SSTs over the two oceans.  Atmospheric circulation anomaly patterns bridging the teleconnections with each ocean also will be examined.  The proposed study will help answer questions regarding how SSTs influence regional climate in high latitudes and at what time scales.  The project also will enhance our understanding of the potential causes for snow increases over the high latitudes in recent decades and should enhance the predictability of climate variations and hydrological phenomena in Eurasia.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.075,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,80000.00,85900,4900,Geography and Spatial Sciences,9911158,,Hengchun Ye,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,hye@csustan.edu,Hengchun,Ye,,Richard J.

"Engineering - Mechanical (56)<br/><br/>This project features a unique type of student project that has been evolving at the University of Idaho for the past eight years. This type of project, entitled the ""Design Build and Test (DBT) Project,"" has a simple theme: the best way to learn engineering is by doing engineering. Our central idea is to evolve the DBT project to a higher level of quality. DBT project development will involve lower division courses, with emphasis on recruiting, retention and development of professional skills. A new wind tunnel is the focus of this synergistic effort combining laboratory improvement with course and curriculum improvement. Projects for the wind tunnel are adapted from several sources: Penn State Behrand (boundary layer experiment), Michigan State University (flow visualization, drag experiment, mini project), Washington State University (special projects), and the Intel Corporation (heat sinks for microprocessors).<br/><br/>Our specific aims are (i) to create a superb wind tunnel facility, (ii) to adapt wind tunnel experiments such as flow visualization and measuring drag to DBT projects, (iii) to develop curriculum materials that support the adaptation, and (vi) to assess and disseminate results.<br/><br/>DBT projects feature math modeling, design, prototype construction, followed by testing. Each project involves the proposed wind tunnel. DBT projects are designed using a common format, and the resulting projects, though small in scale, contain many of the elements typical of a capstone design project. While working on a DBT project, students are immersed in a mentoring environment that creates ownership and pride of workmanship. At the end of a project, students display their work at a design show.<br/><br/>At the completion of this work, we envision an outstanding educational practice (the DBT project), quality assessment data, and detailed project resources that are organized into a book.

"Chemistry (12)<br/>This project attacks two parallel goals involving science education.  Laser-based state-of-the-art physical chemistry laboratory experiments are being adapted from articles in standard journals.  In addition, new experiments are being developed in the general areas of spectroscopy, quantum mechanics, photochemistry and kinetics.  The result is a product which will allow faculty at other institutions to set up turn-key labs even if experience is lacking in these important areas.  This project also introduces undergraduate science students to modern techniques they will encounter in graduate school and the work place.  The areas addressed in this project are currently underrepresented in modern physical chemistry instructional laboratories.  The second major goal is to bring high school teachers currently teaching in the Pacific Northwest states into the new lab for two weeks in the summer to improve their knowledge and skills teaching laboratory science.  The teachers will receive lectures and hands on training using the newest techniques and equipment, while developing the procedures for the new undergraduate physical chemistry labs.  This exposure will present the high school teachers with new knowledge, and allows them to make actual measurements with advanced equipment and learn new lab skills while helping develop the new lab procedures.

"A protein (designated TDBA12) from tobacco plants has been identified that has sequence-specific DNA-binding activity, and that increases markedly during the hypersensitive response to infection with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and following treatment with salicylic acid.  Furthermore, two genes have been isolated that encode proteins with the same DNA-binding specificity as TDBA12 and which are members of the novel WRKY family of DNA-binding proteins recently found in plants.  TDBA12 is sensitive to phosphatase treatment, suggesting a role for protein phosphorylation in its activation.  Potential target genes of TDBA12 include genes encoding proteins with protective and defensive functions as well as regulatory genes.  Transgenic tobacco plants expressing antisense WRKY genes develop spontaneous lesions and exhibit enhanced chlorosis and necrosis after TMV infection.  These observations suggest a general model in which WRKY proteins may be activated as targets of the protein kinase cascade that is activated during plant defense responses.  WRKY proteins in turn may regulate these responses.  The overall objective of these studies is to characterize further the WRKY DNA-binding proteins.  First, the TDBA12 complex will be isolated to identify the subunits associated with DNA-binding activity and to isolate their genes.  Second, transgenic approaches will be taken to decipher the functions of the WRKY genes.  The phenotypes of transgenic tobacco plants expressing antisense RNAs specific for different WRKY proteins will be characterized.  Third, in vitro and in vivo experiments will be used to determine if specific protein kinases are required for TDBA12 activation and, if so, whether WRKY proteins or their interacting proteins are the targets of the regulatory phosphorylation.  A major effort will also be made to isolate the protein kinase that regulates the DNA-binding activity of TDBA12.

"9973345<br/>Baker<br/><br/>Static and flow-through hydrothermal experiments will be performed on mafic and ultramafic rock compositions similar to those known to exist on the surface of Mars.  Experiments will be performed at temperatures from 25-400 degrees C using CO2 -saturated aqueous fluids or CO2 -steam mixtures.  The fluid compositions used will range in salinity from 1000 ppm to several wt % total dissolved chloride and sulfate, and in starting pH from 2 to 8.5.  Fluid - rock ratios will range from 20:1 to 1:20.  Temperature and fluid-rock ratio are expected to strongly control the extent of alteration, while fluid composition should affect the mineral assemblage produced.

"Hartzell<br/><br/>Members of the domain Archaea thrive in extreme environments, including hydrothermal and anaerobic niches, that may represent the conditions on the earth when life originated.  Members of the genus Archaeoglobus are the only sulfate reducers in the Archaea and the only hyperthermophilic sulfate-reducers.  Sulfate-reducers are strict anaerobes that use sulfate as the terminal electron acceptor of dissimilatory sulfate reduction to generate a proton motive force.  This project uses a combination of biochemical and microbial genetic approaches to understand how Archaeoglobus fulgidus utilizes D-lactate as a sole source of carbon for growth and electrons for reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide.  The sequence of the A. fulgidus genome includes a single gene, dld, predicted to encode D-lactate dehydrogenase, the membrane-associated enzyme that oxidizes D-lactate to pyruvate and transfers electrons to the anaerobic respiratory chain.  The dld gene is the central gene of five A. fulgidus genes that likely comprise an operon, which will be tested directly by mapping the start site of the dld mRNA.  Its upstream (noxA2; NADH oxidase) and downstream (abc, ABC transporter) genes may also encode products involved in D-lactate catabolism.  The genes encoding Dld and NoxA2 have been expressed in E. coli.  Dld, purified from E. coli, is thermostable and has D-lactate -specific dehydrogenase activity.  Purified NoxA2 also is stable and requires NAD for activity.  Purified Dld and NoxA2 will be characterized biochemically to identify cofactors and metals that may be involved in electron transfer.  Genetic techniques will be used to identify the critical amino acid residues of these enzymes that are involved in cofactor binding and oxidation-reduction cycles.   To determine if Dld and NoxA2 interact to form a complex, and to identify other proteins that interact with Dld, affinity chromatography and the yeast two-hybrid approach will be used.  A. fulgidus is the first sulfate reducer for which a complete genome sequence is available.  Starting from this sequence, biochemical and genetic approaches will provide powerful tools to reconstitute its unusual respiratory pathway of electron flow that initiates with D-lactate.<br/><br/>Sulfate-reducing organisms play critical roles in the environment by degrading and detoxifying compounds in sediments and waters. The cellular components used to eliminate these compounds are the same proteins that carry out energy production for the sulfate-reducer during growth.  Unlike organisms, including mammals, which use O2 as a sink for electrons during energy production, sulfate-reducers use SO4 as a sink for electrons.  This project is aimed at identifying the proteins that are involved in energy production in the sulfate-reducer, Archaeoglobus fulgidus and determining how these proteins interact with one another to permit the flow of electrons to sulfate.  A. fulgidus, a member of an ancient group of microbes, grows only at very high temperatures (83 C, 181 F).  The project will focus initially on the activity and properties of two proteins, lactate dehydrogenase and NADH oxidase.  These proteins are related to proteins involved in energy production from other single-cells organisms as well as complex organisms, including humans.  The information obtained through this research will help scientists understand which proteins are involved the essential process of energy production and how these proteins link to one another to control this universal, complex process. <br/><br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,315000.00,315000,4900,BIOMOLECULAR PROCESSES,9906433,,Patricia L Hartzell,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,hartzell@uidaho.edu,Patricia,Hartzell,,Neil E.

"Dennis<br/>9981458<br/>     Understanding the fluctuations in animal numbers is a<br/>central issue in population biology that has far-reaching impact<br/>on and implications for problems ranging from food production to<br/>the conservation of species.

A series of experiments<br/>with flour beetles of the genus Tribolium provide rigorous<br/>experimental tests of nonlinear phenomena.  Topics include<br/>nonlinearity in the context of stochasticity, chaos and<br/>population control, the impact of periodic environments on animal<br/>abundance, demographic dynamics and natural selection,<br/>nonequilibrium species interactions, and statistical questions<br/>concerning parameterization and validation of models.<br/>     With a sound understanding of the underlying dynamics of<br/>animal populations, ecologists can anticipate the consequences of<br/>environmental degradation and learn better ways to manage natural<br/>populations and control populations of pests.

"9974124<br/>Sullivan and Swofford<br/> The construction or estimation of phylogenetic branching structure (trees) from DNA sequence data, whether for organisms or their constituent genes, is increasingly important in a wide array of biological studies. Maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation methods are also increasingly being used to construct phylogenetic trees because of several desirable statistical properties of the methods, including the capacity to modify parameters of nucleotide substitution that are thought to influence the rates and patterns of DNA base changes. Realistic models describing the process of nucleotide substitution are now available for use in calculating likelihood values; for example, all six reversible nucleotide substitution types can be allowed to evolve at a unique relative rate, base frequencies can deviate from equality, and different sites (and different codon positions) can be allowed to evolve at different rates. The most complex time-reversible models currently in use thus incorporate the estimation of ten parameters to describe the process of nucleotide substitution, in addition to the calculation of branch lengths for the tree under examaination. The penalty in this complexity is the sheer computational time required to calculate the maximum likelihood score, which becomes prohibitive for nearly all researchers working with more than 20 species in an analysis. Yet, gene-sequencing and genomic sequencing projects are underway for vastly more species, and the analysis of these huge datasets requires improvement in maximum-likelihood search methods.<br/> Dr. Jack Sullivan at the University of Idaho, working with his colleague Dr. David Swofford, is exploring the option of parallel processing of ML searches using the widely available software package PAUP*, in order to conduct iterative searches on the huge numbers of possible trees from large datasets. A multi-step approach will start with published datasets and trees for phylogenies involving small numbers of taxa, then move to larger numbers of taxa, and then add simulation studies on the iterative-search strategy focused on a target dataset of 50 or so taxa. The general goal is to improve upon current ML methods for finding both the optimum tree structure and the optimal combination of topology, branch lengths, and parameters of the model for nucleotide substitution during evolutionary change of a group.<br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,128976.00,128976,4900,PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS,9974124,,Jack M Sullivan,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,jacks@uidaho.edu,Jack,Sullivan,,James E.

"      This Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) project addresses fabrication and characterization of ultrafine grained (Ba,Sr)TiO3 (BST) and related materials, such as BaTiO3 (BT) and SrTiO3 (ST) as sputtering targets using a reactive process.  These materials in thin film condition are very important dielectric constituents for the next generation computer chips.  These sputtering targets are used in producing thin films.  It is proposed to trigger these reactive processes in pressed powder compacts using a hot wire.  The thermodynamics, kinetic studies as well as reaction mechanism studies will be performed.  The microstructure will be characterized and correlated to the processing parameters.  <br/>      The reactive process is economical, uses inexpensive raw materials, and has low energy requirement.  The reactive process also has possibilities of industrial scaling up.  This is important to the career development potential for this new Principle Investigator in starting up her career. The education component of the work will focus mainly on two activities: modification of an existing material processing course for the senior/graduate students and involvement of undergraduates to the advanced processing research area. It is expected that this POWRE project will provide opportunities for future research with significant industrial interest, allowing this new faculty member to focus on a new set of materials while advancing her expertise in the thin film deposition area.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,74991.00,74991,4900,MATERIALS PROCESSING AND MANFG,9973348,,Sutapa Bhaduri,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,sutapabhaduri@yahoo.com,Sutapa,Bhaduri,,Delcie R.

"9901642<br/>Froes<br/><br/>The research project is directed towards creating innovative low-density structural titanium alloys.  Phase I of the program is process oriented, aimed at incorporating low-density magnesium into titanium using two non-equilibrium methods of alloying, mechanical alloying and physical vapor deposition.  The goal is to extend the solid solubility of Mg in the Ti-Mg alloy system; an additional consideration is the effects of incorporating other lightweight elements (aluminum, silicon, and scandium) into the alloys.  Once the processing has extended the solid solubility in the precursor material, the alloys are compacted using low temperature techniques that attempt to avoid excessive phase coarsening.  The microstructure is characterized at various stages of the research with particular interest in dispersions of second phase precipitates that might occur.  If the research in Phase I is successful, Phase II looks toward scaling up the process to create larger amounts of the promising alloys for analysis.<br/>%%%<br/>Titanium alloys are attractive for structural applications because of their high specific strength, excellent environmental resistance, and good fracture-related behavior (fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth rate).

"9814312<br/>Geist<br/>Galapagos shield volcanoes are some of the most active volcanoes in the world and constitute one of the most widespread volcano types in the ocean basins and on other planets. The internal plumbing, the mechanisms of magma migration, and the role of deformation in the evolution of Galapagos-type shield volcanoes are all poorly known, particularly in their type locality. The state of strain within the volcanoes and the emplacement of magma will be monitored through GPS geodetic and microgravity surveys at 51 stations at Fernandina and Sierra Negra volcanoes. After the initial deployment, the GPS networks will be reoccupied annually for two years to measure surface response to active subsurface processes and any eruptive activity. Microgravity measurements will also be carried out at the same stations each year, in order to detect changes in the gravity signal related to internal mass redistribution. This integrated investigation will address: 1) the origin of the characteristic morphology of Galapagos-type shields, 2) the mechanisms of caldera collapse, 3) the strain associated with emplacement of magma, 4) the long-term space accommodation from repeated dike intrusions, and 5) the geometry of magmatic intrusions underlying calderas.

"9874754<br/>Goodwin<br/>This is an award to support research on a process by which all factors that impact on riverine enhancement can be taken into consideration during planning, engineering design and implementation of enhancement procedures.  Implementation of river enhancement plans requires an understanding of the complex interactions between and among factors that influence the decision to undertake enhancement and determine their economic cost and benefits.  These factors are basically determined by the basin's geomorphology which influences its response to conditions that cause flooding.  Basin responses including sediment transport and bank erosion are significantly influenced by changing patterns of development and land use.  The investigator has identified study sites in Idaho that are relatively small in scale to use in conduct of this research.  These include a pristine, undisturbed site in the Frank Church Wilderness, a logged and heavily mined site on the Red River and a grazed rangeland basin drained by Reynolds Creek in the Owyhee Mountains of southwestern Idaho.  Selected heavily urbanized drainage basins selected for study include Wildcat Creek in Richmond, California and San Pedro Creek in Pacifica, California.   The hydraulic research objective is expected to focus on the Willamette River between Albany and Salem in Oregon as an example of a large-scale river and the Napa River in California as an intermediate-scale river.    <br/><br/>The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program that emphasizes combining discovery of new knowledge with inspired teaching and enthusiastic learning.  The research component of this project is expected to result in better procedures than are now available for relating of the costs of riverine restoration to benefits gained than is now possible.  The educational component includes an approach to interest inner-city and rural children in river restoration, introduce undergraduates to ecological restoration by using field-acquired data in undergraduate courses and establishing a project web page and video for the Red River site that will include computer simulations of floods and the geomorphological changes resulting from flooding. <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,199867.00,299867,4900,Nanoscale Interactions Program,9874754,,Peter Goodwin,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,pgoodwin@uidaho.edu,Peter,Goodwin,,Patrick L.

"Youderian<br/>The predatory Gram-negative bacterium, Myxococcus xanthus, derives its metabolic energy primarily from the oxidation of amino acids. This species is the best-characterized representative of the Myxobacteria, the only group of bacteria that respond to starvation (for proteins) by undergoing a program of multicellular development. Previous studies suggested that M. xanthus does not have a ""sweet tooth"". That is, simple hexose sugars including glucose do not stimulate its growth, even on defined medium. However, M. xanthus is sensitive to the glucose analogue, 2-deoxyglucose (2dGIc). This antibiotic is toxic, because it is phosphorylated by hexokinase, the first enzyme in the primary glycolytic pathway for sugar catabolism present in most organisms that utilize glucose. The isolation and characterization of spontaneous mutants of M. xanthus resistant to 2dGIc shows that M. xanthus makes a hexokinase and must transport simple sugars. This hexokinase is unusual, because it is inhibited by the two essential hexosamine sugars glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine. Another bacterial hexokinase, made by E. coil, is also inhibited by the same sugars. The three main goals of this research are: (1) to understand why these enzymes are sensitive to 2dGIc and inhibited by hexosamines; (2), to identify the precise target of 2dGIc-6-phosphate responsible for the toxicity of 2dGIc in most organisms; and (3) to understand the regulatory mechanism in this organism that governs the preference for amino acids over glucose. To accomplish the first task, the kinetics of substrate binding and utilization of these sugars by hexokinase will be examined using kinetic and mechanistic approaches. The hexokinase gene from M. xanthus will be cloned and sequenced, and both the M. xanthus and E. coil enzymes will be purified. Second, the recent discovery that the production of intracellular 2dGIc-6-phosphate results in the depletion of ATP in M. xanthus, as it does in mammalian cells, has led to the search for the critical enzyme involved in central carbon metabolism specifically inhibited by low concentrations of 2dGIc-6-phosphate, again using traditional biochemical tactics. Third, glucose catabolism in M. virescens, which oxidizes glucose readily, and in M. xanthus, which may not, will be compared.<br/><br/>Many living organisms, like humans, burn sugars for energy, but prefer a rich protein diet. The soil bacterium, Myxococcus xanthus, chooses a protein-rich diet (""steak"") over a carbohydrate-rich diet (""potatoes"") to an extreme, because sugar doesn't stimulate its growth. The goal of this research is to understand why some individual organisms have this kind of dietary preference. Biochemical studies show that the steak-loving bacterium M. xanthus can still taste sugars, because it is fooled by the sweet poison of 2-deoxyglucose, which tastes like sweet glucose-rich Gatorade TM, but has the opposite effect. This poison, 2-deoxyglucose, has been known to be toxic to most living things for 50 years. No one really understands why, except for the finding that it drains ATP (energy) levels in many living cells, including M. xanthus.  M. xanthus will be used as a model organism to figure out why this poison is a poison, and, at the same time, gain fundamental insights at a basic chemical level about how organisms choose what to eat.<br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,300000.00,200000,4900,,9808848,,Philip A Youderian,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,hartzell@uidaho.edu,Patricia,Hartzell,,Judith Plesset,,,08/26/1998,09/01/1998,07/31/2001,2-Deoxyglucose Kills Myxococcus Xanthus,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,L,,
"NONTECHNICAL ABSTRACT  Proposal Number:  9808377      Principal Investigator:  John A. Byers        Many studies conducted in the past decade have confirmed the  once-controversial prediction that female animals in nature  should choose their  mates carefully.  That females in many  animal species actively choose mates is now established  fact.  The larger questions that remain concern how and why  females choose.  ""How"" questions involve study of the  behavioral strategies and sensory systems that females use  in mate choice.  ""Why"" questions concern the value to  females in exercising choice. The goal of this one-year  project is to develop a genetic paternity analysis for  pronghorn, a large mammal native to the North American  plains and deserts.  This species is particularly useful in  the study of these ""how"" and ""why"" questions in female  choice behavior.  At the National Bison Range in  northwestern Montana, small tissue samples will be obtained  by hand capture of young animals or by remote biopsy darts  from adults.  These samples will be used to develop the  methodology for using DNA microsatellites as genetic markers  for this population.  The paternity analysis developed by  this work will allow study of these questions in future  years, and in particular study of whether females are able  to choose genetically superior mates.      This research addresses central issues relevant to choice  behavior in nature that is widely applicable to many  species.

This facility  will support a strong interdisciplinary program in  conservation biology, ecology, and natural resource  management at the University of Idaho.  Natural resources  sciences have reached a new era in basic and applied  research that requires the use of molecular genetic tools to  address specific questions that are critical for these  fields.  The rapid advancement in molecular biology  techniques and invention of automated DNA sequencing and  genotyping has enormously increased the productivity,  accuracy, and safety of these techniques.  The result of  this advancement is the opening of an exciting new realm of  research directions in the fields of conservation genetics,  molecular ecology, molecular systematics, and molecular  pathology.  The goals of this equipment grant are to develop  a Molecular Genetics Core Facility to expand and explore  research directions by 1) improving research capabilities,  2) developing a new level of interdisciplinary  collaboration, and 3) providing new research training and  educational opportunities in the areas of conservation  genetics, molecular ecology, molecular systematics, and  molecular pathology.  Three principal investigators, seven affiliated faculty, and  numerous graduate and undergraduate students will initially  share the proposed research facility.  The three principal  investigators have strong backgrounds in molecular genetic  research and span the major disciplines of the College -  plant, animal, and fisheries sciences.  The seven affiliated  faculty members have less molecular genetic experience, but  propose to expand their research to incorporate molecular  methods  when this facility is established.

"Klowden  9807538    In many species of mosquitoes, the females mate only once during their  lives. When the males inseminate the females shortly after they emerge,  they not only receive sperm to fertilize their eggs, but also products that  are transferred from the accessory gland of the male. These accessory gland  products have been believed to be active in the female in various ways,  switching her behavior to turn off subsequent mating behavior and activate  egg-laying, but these generalizations have been based on the easily  colonized Aedes mosquitoes that are usually the subjects of laboratory  research. None of the previous studies for which this accessory gland  mechanism has been determined have examined Anopheles mosquitoes, which are  important vectors of malaria. The PIs preliminary experiments indicate that  in these Anopheles mosquitoes, male accessory glands indeed have no role in  the behavioral switchover, although mating itself does affect the female in  several ways. The PIs research will determine how Anopheles mosquitoes are  affected by mating, and what possible role male accessory gland substances  do play in these mosquitoes. Because future methods of mosquito control may  involve the introduction of novel genes by modified males, it is important  to understand the mechanisms that regulate mating in these vectors of human  disease.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,120000.00,120000,4900,ECOLOGICAL & EVOLUTIONARY PHYS,9807538,,Marc J Klowden,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,mklowden@uidaho.edu,Marc,Klowden,,Erik T.

"9714887  Oldow   In circumstances where the convergence vector between two plates is oblique to the suture, deformation is partitioned into arc-parallel (strike-slip) and arc normal (thrust) components.  The parameters controlling this partitioning are not well known, and several models exist.  This research in the Aleutian arc takes advantage of a curved suture between plate where the vector varies smoothly from near O (orthogonal) to near 90o (pure strike-slip) to address some of the possible parameters.  If the coupling between upper and lower plates remains constant, increasing arc-parallel extension in the upper plate with increasing obliquity should be observed.  However, no arc-parallel extension need occur if coupling decreases with increasing obliquity.  This project will employ GPS technology to determine translations of the islands along the Aleutian arc and structural analysis to determine operative slip and deformation response.

Issues to be addressed include the sensitivity of radiative and   nonradiative relaxation rates to solvent isotopomer, the validity of   treating solvent response as independent of the solute electronic state,   the possible dependence of solvent-induced electronic dephasing on   vibrational mode, and the role of solvent intramolecular modes in   electronic dephasing.   Molecules dissolved in liquid solvents exhibit behaviors that are much   affected by the solvent molecules in the surrounding environment.  These   interactions are complex and still not understood well at this time.    Results from this project will help to bridge the gap  between   theoretical predictions and real systems in understanding solution   dynamics.

"     One of the most fundamental challenges pervading  theoretical nuclear physics for half a century is to  understand the properties of atomic nuclei in terms of the  basic forces between nucleons (protons and neutrons).  In  spite of the progress made in the past, our present  understanding still has many gaps and deficiencies.  It is  the purpose of this project to substantially advance this  field of microscopic nuclear structure.       First, we will improve the theory of the basic nuclear  force--the interaction between two nucleons.  We will  develop more quantitative nuclear potentials, which can  serve as reliable input for microscopic nuclear structure  calculations.  Moreover, we will also improve the foundation  of the nuclear force model: it must be based upon the  fundamental theory of strong interactions, quantum  chromodynamics (QCD), and the theory of relativity of Albert  Einstein.       The second stepping stone in our program is the three  nucleon problem which can be solved exactly. The final step  in our proposed research is nuclear matter--the stuff that  atomic nuclei are made of.  A topical issue is the question  of how the interaction between two nucleons changes in the  nuclear matter environment.  This information is important  for the theory of nuclear reactions involving heavy nuclei  (heavy ion collisions).",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.049,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,134564.00,134564,4900,NUCLEAR THEORY,9603097,,Ruprecht Machleidt,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,machleid@uidaho.edu,Ruprecht,Machleidt,,Sidney A.

"9626764 Krone  ABSTRACT  The projects in this proposal fall into two categories: population genetics (especially genealogical processes and sampling theory in models with selection) and interacting particle systems (especially multitype models motivated by ecology).  Due in large part to the recent explosion of DNA  sequence data, two significant trends have emerged in population genetics over the past 20 years.  Firstly, the theory now focuses on sampling distributions  and the inferences that can be drawn from them.  Secondly, the retrospective  view (often referred to as coalescent theory) replaced the former prospective view.  By studying ancestry, much of the unnecessary structure is stripped away and simple flexible models emerge.  Coalescent theory has had much success in analyzing neutral models (i.e., models with no selection); however, the corresponding selective theory has, for the most part, remained out of reach.  Recent progress by one of the PI's has opened up many avenues of research on biologically relevant problems.  It is shown that genealogical information is embedded in the dual processes of certain interacting particle systems.  The investigators propose to extend these techniques to include a variety of models, most notably models involving DNA polymorphism and recombination.  Sampling theory for models with selection will also be developed.  The sampling theory for a large class of models is characterized and is analogous to the exponential family.  Thus the theory of inference, including parameter estimation, information criteria, hypothesis testing, and model selection will be developed rigorously.  Interacting particle systems are ideal for modeling biological systems with spatial structure.  In recent years, tools have been developed for dealing with multitype particle systems. These multitype systems are particularly relevant in ecological models.  A number of multitype models of competition and succession are proposed.  Some of the key features in the proposed model s are the effects of different dispersal ranges and random environments.  The problems in this proposal are motivated by important issues in population genetics and ecology.  Mathematical models are useful for several reasons.  The time scales of interest in many biological settings are often hundreds or thousands of years (e.g., forest succession, evolutionary changes, etc.), and hence it is important to be able to predict long-term effects when certain characteristics of the population are changed.  Another example of a timely issue which precludes a ""wait and see"" approach is the extinction of endangered species.  The models and analysis proposed will allow for qualitative and quantitative predictions, as well as efficient simulation strategies.  Significant contributions to the mathematical underpinnings of these models are also expected.  The proposed work on population genetics will address the effects of natural selection on genealogy.  This is crucial for developing efficient tests for selection, determining how powerful these tests are, deciding which selective models are realistic and what their properties are.  Spatial models in ecology will be approached through ""interacting particle systems.""  Issues such as the spread and control of disease in plant communities, extinction of populations in subdivided habitats, and the effects of inhomogeneous environments will be addressed.  The models proposed are much more complicated than most models in the literature because they take into account the spatial structure that is inherent (and important) in real populations.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.049,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,32000.00,32000,4900,PROBABILITY,9626764,,Stephen Krone,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,krone@uidaho.edu,Stephen,Krone,,K Crank,,,07/29/1996,08/01/1996,01/31/1999,Stochastics Models in Population Genetics and Ecology,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Paul Joyce'],,,

"    9508088  Miller    The long term goal of this project is to address mechanistic  questions concerning the orderly differentiation and spatial  organization of diverse cell types into morphologies specific for  a tissue or developmental state. Conidiation in the filamentous  fungus Aspergillus nidulans offers the unique opportunity to  investigate molecular mechanisms that control multicellular  development in eukaryotes.  Conidiation is characterized by its  highly synchronous nature and the spatial organization of a limited  number of differentiated cell types. A genetic hierarchy consisting  of five essential regulatory genes controls 1) the transition from  multinucleate filamentous growth to uninucleate budding growth, the  assembly of a multicellular reproductive structure  (conidiophore)and 3) the production of dormant conidia (spores).  Complex regulatory interactions provide a mechanism for  establishing overlapping spatiotemporal gradients in the  transcription factors which, in turn, coordinately activate  hundreds of conidiation specific genes. The objectives of this  proposal are to begin elucidating mechanisms that integrate  spatiotemporal control of developmental gene expression with  alterations in cell cycle regulation. Dr. Miller is approaching  this problem through a molecular analysis of the modifier genes  Medusa (medA) and Stunted (stuA). The medA protein is required for  commitment to the developmental program, functioning as a co-  activator of a subset of target genes. The stuA protein belongs to  a family of transcription factors that control cell cycle  progression and fungal development. The specific objectives are to  1) identify, isolate and characterize regulatory gene(s) required  for competence dependent stuA transcription, one of the earliest  events of the developmental program; 2) identify and characterize  gene(s) required for early induction dependent, brlA-independent  medA transcription; 3) functionally characterize the medA and stuA  proteins; 4) isol ate stuA target genes and 5) characterize  extragenic suppressors of stuA mutations and extragenic mutations  that mimic the Stunted phenotype.  ***",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,300000.00,300000,4900,PLANT FUNGAL & MICROB DEV MECH,9508088,,Bruce L Miller,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,bmiller@uidaho.edu,Bruce,Miller,,Judith Plesset,,,06/16/1995,10/01/1995,09/30/1999,Generation of Multicellular Structures in Aspergillus,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,L,,
"9510078  Marshall    Stable carbon isotope ratios and stomatal characters of Miocene leaves will be compared to those of modern leaves from nearest living relatives (NLR) Herbarium specimens of the NLR's will be analyzed to calibrate isotopic composition and stomatal characters against the 30% increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and the 1.2% decrease in isotopic composition since the industrial revolution.  Using the calibrations, we will obtain from the fossil data ten to twenty independent, taxon-specific estimates of the isotopic composition and concentration of carbon dioxide in the Miocene atmosphere.  The fossil leaves are of subtropical and temperate trees deposited ca. 15 million years ago in anoxic lake sediments near clarkia, Idaho.  The dominant trees in the flora included species of  Quercus, Castanea, Pseudofagus, Metasequoia , and Taxodium.  These remarkably preserved fossils have previously yielded DNA, taxon-specific flavonoid profiles, and are sometimes still pigmented when first removed from the sediments.  They are, to our knowledge, the best preserved specimens of this age in the world.  Nonetheless to minimize the influence of diagenesis on isotopic composition all comparisons will rely on lignin extracted from the modern leaves and the fossils.  Stomatal density (# stomata per m2  of leaf surface) and stomatal size will be measured on replicate samples of all leaves; stomatal index (#stomata/(#stomata + epidermal cells)) will be measured where possible.  New collections of the nearest living relatives will also be made to quantify the effects of canopy position and altitude above sea level.  The middle Miocene was a time of rapidly falling temperatures and CO2 concentrations.  Published estimates of atmospheric composition rely on isotopic data from ocean sediments, which are uncertain because they are several steps removed from the atmosphere.  We propose an alternative means of reconstructing atmospheric composition based on land plants, which are better  coupled to the atmosphere.  Because individual genera can be analyzed separately, the work will provide an independent estimate of atmospheric composition from each genus.  If successful, this work may eventually lead to analyses of Miocene terrestrial photosynthesis, one of the major biogeochemical processes removing CO2   from the atmosphere, and may constrain our estimates of terrestrial ecosystem responses to the ongoing increase in atmospheric CO2.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,191611.00,191611,4900,GLOBAL CHANGE,9510078,,John D Marshall,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,jdm@uidaho.edu,John,Marshall,,H.

"9453741  Teasdale    To change the perceptions that young women have about themselves, as well as about the fields  of engineering as career options, a two-week summer engineering experience for young men and  women will be offered by the University of Idaho College of Engineering.  The workshop will  incorporate strategies to improve:  the instructional climate provided by the faculty; the  understanding of gender and cultural diversity issues by students, faculty, and counselors; and  the self-esteem of the young women.  The new strategies and approaches will be incorporated  into an ongoing summer experience for high school students which has been offered for a  number of years, but which previously had not been successful in attracting young women.    This project will offer the first opportunity for a university experience for most of the students.   They will register for a two-credit pre-engineering course, live on the University campus, attend  courses and work in laboratories in University buildings, as well as use other University  facilities.  The college atmosphere will provide a transitional experience for the students which  will be valuable when they attend college after high school graduation.  It is anticipated that not  only will the young women develop more positive perceptions about their abilities in math,  science, and engineering, and change perceptions about engineering as a career option, but that  the young men will have a better understand of diversity issues and profit from the enhanced  learning environment.  ***",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.076,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,62530.00,62530,4900,RES ON GENDER IN SCI & ENGINE,9453741,,Jean A Teasdale,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,jeant@uidaho.edu,Jean,Teasdale,,Lola E.

"9408317  Brown   Differences in gene regulation in natural populations of organisms may serve as the most important source of genetic variation for the process of natural selection.  The purpose of the proposed research is to investigate one of the molecular aspects of gene regulation, namely gene transcription, in response to positive selection, neutral mutation, and purifying selection.  In a glucose-limited environment, genes engaged in glucose metabolism are under strong selection, and the genes for galactose metabolism are not used.  Positive selection for enhanced glucose utilization may lead to increased activity of genes involved in galactose metabolism leading to the loss of galactose inducibility in these genes.  In this environment, the sole nitrogen source is ammonium sulfate, and yeast must metabolize all amino acids.  Genes for amino acid metabolism are critically important for cell growth, and their regulation is subject to purifying selection.  The first objective of the proposed work is to assess the effect of positive selection on transcriptional regulation of genes whose products are involved in glucose metabolism; the effect of neutral mutations on the inducibility of genes whose products are involved in galactose metabolism, and the effect of purifying selection on the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in amino acid synthesis.  The second objective is to determine whether nucleotide sequence differences in the promoter regions of genes may account for the transcriptional differences.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,18000.00,18000,4900,POPULATION DYNAMICS,9408317,,Celeste J Brown,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,celesteb@uidaho.edu,Celeste,Brown,,Mary C.

"Mature oil seeds (cucumber, pumpkin, peanut, Brassica, etc) contain             few mitochondria and have low levels of tricarboxylic acid (TCA)                cycle enzymes.  Following imbibition the TCA cycle enzymes are                  synthesized de novo.  The biogenesis of the TCA cycle enzymes,                  however, is not uniform.  The non-decarboxylative portion of the                pathway (the reactions between succinate and oxaloacetate) is                   synthesized first.  A few days later, the enzymes of the                        decarboxylative part of the cycle, the reactions between pyruvate               (or citrate) and succinate, are formed.  This switch results from               changing metabolism in the cotyledons of these seeds.  Early in                 germination the cotyledons are converting stored lipid to                       carbohydrate.  While the non-decarboxylative portion of the TCA                 cycle is essential for this process the decarboxylative portion is              not present thus preventing carbon loss through the decarboxylation             reactions.  Later as these tissues become photosynthetic, a full                TCA cycle is needed and the enzymes of the decarboxylative portion              are synthesized.  In this proposal Dr. Oliver will examine the                  mechanism by which this differential expression of mitochondrial                proteins is accomplished using fumarase, an enzyme specific for the             non-decarboxylative part, and the NAD+-dependent isocitrate                     dehydrogenase, an enzyme found only in the decarboxylative portion              of the TCA cycle.  The proteins have been purified, antibody tools              are being produced, and N-terminal sequence information is being                obtained.  The antibody and/or oligonucleotide probes will be used              to isolate the cDNA (and then genomic) clones for these two                     proteins.  The level of control of gene expression(transcriptional,             translational, etc) will be determined by measuring mRNA levels and             with run on transcription assays.  Promoter-GUS contructs will be               transformed into Brassica napus and these transgenic plants will be             used to study, 1. the time course and tissue specificity of                     expression of both genes, 2. environmental and physiological                    factors that control the expression of these two genes, and 3.                  repression of TCA cycle proteins during seed maturation.

One such insect behavior that has led to much human                 suffering is the one that allows a mosquito to find a host for a                meal of blood.  Using various chemical and visual signals that we               humans give off, mosquitos are able to locate us and ingest our                 blood, and in the process transmit often deadly disease agents.                 Dr. Klowden is an internationally renown expert on mosquito                     behavior in the complex environment.  He has identified times                   when the insect itself controls its behavior and does not seek a                host.  Using these periods of inaction, Dr. Klowden identified a                novel FMRFamide-related neuropeptide, Aedes Head Peptide 1, that                specifically inhibits host seeking behavior in the yellow fever                 mosquito, and prevents them from feeding on blood.  Using                       extremely difficult technical/surgical techniques, he can begin                 to unravel the mechanisms by which Aedes Head Peptide 1 prevents                mosquito host-seeking behavior from occurring, and how this                     hormone interacts with other factors.  The results from these                   fundamental studies are likely to lead to new discoveries that                  will substantially impact progress in the neuroendocrinology of                 insects and insect behavior.

Concurrent with                  an inquiry-centered laboratory-based content course is the                      development of a practicum in which the pre-service students                    will work with master teacher/mentors teachers to translate                     science content into actual learning situations with children.

"     Mobile genetics sequences, or transposable elements, are                   ubiquitous features of mammalian genomes.  They cause mutations by              inactivation of genes, by changing the regulation of gene                       expressions, and by acting as sites for recombination which leads               to chromosomal rearrangement.  To understand the ways in which                  transposable elements affect the organisms, we need a more accurate             assessment of transposition rates, and an understanding of the                  mechanisms by which elements within the genome interact.  In this               regard, it has been observed that elements compared from within a               single species are generally more similar to each other than                    elements from two related species.  This phenomenon, known as                   concerted evolution, suggests that elements are rapidly homogenized             by some force(s) acting within a species.  Concerted evolution is               a common feature of transposable elements families, but is usually              observed at the species level or above.                                              This project examines a unique example of concerted evolution              of transposable elements at the population level.  Concerted                    evolution has been shown to occur in hundreds of copies of the mys              retrotransposon in a single geographic population of the white-                 footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, near Orono, Maine.  Although                 concerted evolution of mammalian transposable elements is generally             believed to result from transposition by one or a few ""molecular                drivers"", data from this population suggest that biased gene                    conversion may be the mechanism operating here.  Furthermore, this              gene conversion appears to effect only part of the mys element.                 The specific objectives of this project are:  i) to determine the               proportion of mys elements in the Maine population which have                   undergone concerted evolution; ii) to test the hypothesis that                  concerted evolution of mys within this  population is due to biased             gene conversion; and iii) to formulate hypotheses to explain the                apparently limited region of the element undergoing gene                        conversion.  Methods employed will include radioanalytic imaging of             genomic Southern blots and DNA sequence comparisons of elements                 from the population of interest and orthologous elements from                   control populations.  This study will be one of the first to                    examine the population biology of a mammalian transposable element.             Concerted evolution in this population may well provide insight in              to some previously unrecognized process by which transposable                   elements interact within the genome and influence the genetic basis             of population adaptation to changing conditions.//",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,280000.00,280000,4900,POPULATION DYNAMICS,9220520,,Holly A Wichman,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,hwichman@uidaho.edu,Holly,Wichman,,Mark Courtney,,,04/13/1993,03/01/1993,08/31/1998,Concerted Evolution of a Retrotransposon Within a Geographic Population,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,A,,
"Hybridization has been of major importance for plant evolution.                 Recent research has shown that hybrid plant resistance to                       herbivores may differ from resistance of pure parental plants to                herbivores.  Hybrids could be more, less, equally, or                           intermediately resistant compared to parental species.  Determining             if one of these patterns is prevalent could contribute to                       understanding important ecological and evolutionary aspects of                  plant-herbivore interactions, as well as the role of hybrids in                 considering issues of biological diversity.  This project focuses               on willow species and their hybrids that co-occur in the same                   habitat.  The two parent willow species have different chemical                 systems in their leaves that can be studied in the hybrids and                  parents.  The PI has developed molecular genetic markers to                     characterize naturally occurring and crossed hybrids and parental               species.  The PI will analyze the relationships between                         hybridization, chemical variation and herbivore resistance for                  field plants, and cloned and seedling plants in a common garden.                He will test if differences in chemical expression are correlated               with herbivore resistance of hybrids, and will use molecular                    markers to determine the frequency of hybridization in several                  communities that have both willow species.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,73427.00,78402,4900,POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG,9208826,,Steven J Brunsfeld,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,sbruns@uidaho.edu,Steven,Brunsfeld,,Scott L.

"                                                                                     This project is a three-year study of reworked volcaniclastic              deposits in the Eocene Challis volcanic field in central Idaho.                 The project focuses on two major goals.  The first is                           identification of changes in sedimentation style and pattern that               result from different types of volcanic eruptions.  The second goal             is analysis of bias in the sedimentary record of volcanism.                          Deposits of the Challis volcanic field represent a long period             of volcanic activity (51 to 40 million years ago) characterized by              an initial period of predominantly non-explosive intermediate                   volcanism followed by caldera-forming volcanism.  The sedimentary               system associated with this volcanism comprises high - and low -                 sinuosity streams, lakes (claystone - tuff and turbidite                       components), and debris - flow aprons deposited by lahars.  The                 study will identify the signal of different eruption types in a                 diverse assemblage of depositional environments.  The study will                also identify which environments are most sensitive to perturbation             by eruption and therefore, contain the best record of volcanic                  activity.                                                                            The study is field - oriented, combining lithostratigraphy,                tephra fingerprinting, and petrofacies stratigraphy to produce the              detailed correlation framework needed to achieve the projects                   goals.

"     The investigators undertake an interdisciplinary project to                test nonlinear population theory, incorporating the construction                and analysis of mathematical models, the design and                             implementation of biological experiments, and the development and               application of statistical techniques for the analysis of data.                 They use flour beetles of the genus Tribolium as the experimental               organism.  In the first part of the project they identify                       appropriate models and estimate the parameters that control the                 detailed behavior of the models.  In the second part they                       document transitions in the qualitative behavior of the                         demographic dynamics.  They use combinations of reproductive                    rates and adult mortality rates that span boundaries in parameter               space from stable equilibria, to invariant cycles, to chaos.  In                the third part they test hypotheses concerning the existence of                 these unusual demographic phenomena and develop methods for                     identifying the phenomena in experimental data.

In addition, Dr. Armbruster's                               laboratory in Bern, where the joint work will be carried                        out, possesses state-of-the-art instruments and computers                       that are necessary for the proposed research.  In 1990,                         Gunter and Armbruster performed crystal structure                               analysis on clinoptilolite, a mineral form of a zeolite,                        at five different hydration levels.  Their current plans                        are to expand that work by measuring optical                                    characteristics at various hydration levels.  These data                        will help them to understand the effects of water on the                        optical properties of this mineral and to develop a                             simple method to correlate the properties to dehydration                        level.  This will lay the groundwork for future optical                         studies on this mineral and other zeolites with different                       liquids occupying the channels.                                                                                                                                 Zeolites are a large mineral group with an unusual                              structure comprised of channels in a framework.  These                          channels give them commercially important uses as                               ""molecular sieves,"" for applications such as water                              purification, petroleum refining, and radioactive waste                         treatment.  For example, the subject of the proposed                            joint work, clinoptilolite, can absorb radioactive cesium                       and was used recently in the cleanup of Chernobyl.  Very                        thorough characterization of zeolites will lead to a much                       better understanding of their crystal chemistry and                             physical properties and may make it possible to improve                         the ""sieving"" properties of these minerals.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.079,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,5000.00,5000,4900,SWITZERLAND,9123567,,Mickey E Gunter,,,,"""""",,,,mgunter@uidaho.edu,Mickey,Gunter,,Christine French,,,06/30/1992,07/01/1992,12/31/1993,U.S.-Switzerland Cooperative Research on Zeolite Dehydration,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,E,,
"Sierra Negra and Cerro Azul Volcanoes make up the southern end of               Isabela Island in the Galapagos Archipelago.

"     The primary goal of this project is to conduct an                          intercomparison on the measurement of sulfur gases in the air                   between various research groups who are measuring the gases.  These             gases are of major atmospheric importance, but at this time we do               not know if the different analytical instrumentation and methods                are equivalent in their measurement capability.  This is due to the             variety of preconcentration methods and equipment which are used to             measure the gases and to the high reactivity of these sulfur gases              with a variety of chemical species in the air, water, soils, etc.               This proposal is an omnibus proposal to provide for the logistical              support to perform the intercomparison and to analyze the data                  generated from the intercomparison.  The experimental design is                 such that both laboratory and field exercises will be performed and             that the range of concentration for intercalibration of each gas                will be from about five times the minimum detectable limit of each              gas to two orders of magnitude higher.  This range will cover the               range of natural measurements (part per trillion by volume to part              per billion by volume) and provide an experiment which can provide              for good statistical validity in the intercomparison.  A successful             intercomparison, with the validation of several research groups to              measure sulfur gases, will result in the ability to perform                     coordinated research projects to understand the vital role of                   sulfur in global climate change.//",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,454186.00,454186,4900,Atmospheric Chemistry,9215351,,Douglas L MacTaggart,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,dmactagg@silver.sdsmt.edu,Douglas,MacTaggart,,Jarvis L.

"     The goal of the research is to enhance the development of                  product requirements through a better understanding of customer                 requirements.  Customer requirements are those things that                      customers would like to see realized in a product and are usually               represented qualitatively before concepts are developed.  Product               requirements are quantitative, and measurable parameters of a                   product that will satisfy customer requirements.  For example, a                customer requirement for the ON-OFF button of a remote control may              be that ""it gives a snap feedback response against my finger when               I push it"".  From this information, the product team needs to                   develop product requirements to define the product, such as ""return             force = 6 N"" and ""button travel = 0.5 centimeters"".                                  This research is a multidisciplinary effort joining expertise              in engineering and marketing along with industrial involvement for              an endeavor that is both applicable and relevant.  Product                      requirements that are quantitative and measurable are essential for             product definition.  For design projects that involve several                   individuals, a documented set of requirements is essential for                  project management and reaching consensus among team members.

"     The primary goal of this project is to design, construct,                  and validate a reliable calibration system for preparing ultra-                 trace gas standards for five sulfur-containing compounds;                       hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, carbonyl sulfide, carbon                      disulfide, and dimethylsulfide.

Consequently, an intercomparison                    project is being developed by the scientific community to                       address this issue.

"The goal of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                     Organometallic Chemistry Program is the synthesis and                           characterization of a wide variety of new fluorine-containing                   nitrogen and/or phosphorus compounds. It is expected that the                   presence of fluorine will endow the new compounds with                          desirable properties, such as special high temperature                          stabilities and concommitant high densities and long liquid                     ranges, compared to nonfluorinated analogs.                                                                                                                     The target compounds for synthesis are in three families:                       (A) fluorinated cyclophosphazenes and polyphosphazenes;                         (B) fluorinated tetrazoles and other tetraza-5-membered ring                    systems; and (C) fluorinated high-nitrogen compounds. Many of                   the new compounds will be synthesized by procedures analogous                   to those used for nonfluorinated analogs, but using fluorinated                 starting materials. In other cases fluorination will be                         accomplished with either carbonyl fluoride or trifluoroamine                    oxide.

A partial clone for the                    dicarboxylate transporter has already been isolated and the                     work will initially concentrate on this protein.  Once full                     length clones are available, they will be sequenced and                         molecular modelling techniques used to evaluate their                           structures within the membrane.  When a structural model has                    been obtained, it will be tested by using antibodies and                        chemical modifiers, both targeted to synthetic peptides, to                     confirm the model by evaluating that portions of the proteins                   are exposed to the cytosolic and matrix face of the                             mitochondrial membrane.  The cDNA clones will be used to                        produce the precursor form of the protein by in vitro                           transcription/translation and heterologous expression in                        bacteria.  These immature forms of the protein will be used                     to study the incorporation of the transporter into the                          mitochondrial membrane.  They also will be used in an attempt                   to isolate and reconstitute the receptor protein that is                        responsible for recognizing the transport protein and guiding                   its incorporation into the membrane.

The mitochondrion has                    a very complex membrane structure which has not been                            amendable to biochemical analysis.

Thus it appears that thermosensitive                   mechanisms control food intake in situations when a thermogenic                 activity, food intake, is counter-productive to the maintenance                 of normal body temperature.  The neural substrates involved in                  the thermal control of food intake are poorly understood.                       Preliminary findings indicate that the neurotoxin, capsaicin,                   damages neural fibers involved in heat-induced reduction of food                intake without altering the ability to maintain normothermia at                 elevated temperature in rats.  This suggests that capsaicin acts                to selectively lesion thermosensitive systems controlling food                  intake.  Examination of functional deficits in thermoregulation                 and food intake reduction at elevated temperatures in rats                      treated systemically, and at localized central and peripheral                   sites with capsaicin should reveal the lesion sites responsible                 for the functional deficits.  The specificity of capsaicin-                     induced damage to thermal controls of food intake at central or                 peripheral sites will be further examined using                                 immunohistochemical and silverstain degeneration techniques.                    Finally, peptides will be applied at sites that demonstrate                     impairment of heat-induced reduction of food intake.

"Molecular Science, fundamental to all of science and engineering                (S&amp;E) is viewed as:  the University of Idaho's strongest research               area; an area that can be gradually strengthened at other Idaho                 institutions; and an important discipline in Idaho's future.  The               goals of Idaho's Implementation Plan for the Experimental Program to            Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) are to:  a) improve the                 quality of basic molecular science research at the University of                Idaho; b) enhance the ability of molecular science faculty in Idaho             to compete successfully and consistently for Federal research funds.

The work will focus on                     fluorine chemistry including development of new fluorine                        compounds by introducing fluorine atoms to specific known                       chemicals and characterizing the resulting new materials.  The                  characterization will be via infrared, mass, and NMR spectral                   techniques. The possibilities for major contributions in                        agricultural, health and industrial environments are large.  This               research will require updating facilities at Chandigarh to handle               the difficult compounds involved, including special glass and                   metal vacuum lines, and appropriate reaction vessels.

Molecular                  genetic techniques will be used to clone and physically                         characterize the stunted gene in order to begin an investigation                of the gene product's biochemical function; to elucidate the                    temporal expression of this gene during development in the wild                 type strain and in other developmental mutants; to investigate                  the affects of experimentally altered stunted gene expression                   upon conidiophore development and to isolate novel stuA alleles.                Double mutants will be generated for the purpose of investigating               potential interactions, at the molecular level, of genes                        responsible for normal asexual reproduction and to relate these                 interactions to structure formation.                                            %%%                                                                             A fundamental problem in biology is the elucidation of molecular                mechanisms that mediate cell differentiation and the organization               of cell types during morphogenesis.

"This award supports Dr. Harley Johansen and a graduate student from             the University of Idaho to collaborate with Dr. Arvo Naukkarinen of             Oulu University, Finland, in a comparative study of community                   development in Finland and the U.S.  The objective of their research            is to understand better the process of business growth in rural                 communities and how various development strategies can enhance this             process.  Rural community development in Finland and the United                 States has similar goals, but in each country development is pursued            by significantly different strategies.  This collaborative research             will examine how Finland's centralized program of regional planning             policy has worked to stimulate economic development of rural                    communities, and how this kind of external assistance and funding               compares with the predominantly local development efforts found in              American small towns.  Research will involve data collection in                 Finland to replicate a study conducted in the U.S. among a national             sample of 100 small towns that were surveyed in 1981 and 1986.                                                                                                  Economic development in rural locations is an important goal among              most countries today.  A variety of strategies for economic growth              in peripheral regions has evolved along with a greater understanding            of the complexity of development problems.  This research will                  provide insights into how the process of mobilization and promotion             of growth in small towns works, how external help can create growth             in less developed areas which do not have local resources for                   development, and whether external funding and assistance can create             preconditions for sustained growth.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.079,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,14178.00,14178,4900,Geography and Spatial Sciences,8714047,,Harley E Johansen,,,,"""""",,,,johansen@uidaho.edu,Harley,Johansen,,Christine French,,,05/23/1988,06/01/1988,11/30/1990,U.S.-Finland Cooperative Research: Comparison of National   Versus Local Development Efforts in Small Towns in Finland  and the U.S.,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,E,,

"                                                                                The design of many engineered structures is governed by considerations          of material fatigue failure.  For example, offshore structures must             withstand continuous oscillatory wind and wave loads.  Under extreme            conditions, the loading may fluctuate significantly over short time             periods.  Substantial damage, and most failures, are caused by these            short-time loads.                                                                                                                                               Existing methodologies for evaluating the probability of fatigue failure        assume that the loading process is stationary (that is, the loading             characteristics do not change with time), which may not be appropriate          for extreme loading conditions.  This study develops a reliability model        for fatigue failure that accommodates nonstationary loading processes.          The model describes the response of the structure to nonstationary loads        as a random process.  The crossing statistics of this response process          are calculated in order to determine the expected number of load                reversals; the accumulated damage resulting from these load reversals is        determined using the methods of fracture mechanics.  Finally, the               estimated damage can be compared to a limiting criteria so as to                calculate the probability of failure.                                                                                                                           This methodology improves upon existing procedures for the design of            structures prone to fatigue failure under nonstationary loads, such as          those caused by an earthquake.  This information can also be used to            specify rational design, inspection, maintenance, and                           repair schemes for many types of structures.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,59136.00,59136,4900,STRUCTURES II,8707789,,Richard J Nielsen,,,,"""""",,,,rnielsen@uidaho.edu,Richard,Nielsen,,Shih-Chi Liu,,,06/29/1987,08/01/1987,01/31/1990,Fatigue Reliability of Structures Sujected to Earthquake    Loading,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,J,,
"        Professor Philip Deutchman is a major contributor to the                field of heavy-ion collisions in nuclear physics, i.e., the study               of what happens when you scatter one atomic nucleus on another.                 In the last few years he has become an expert regarding the                     problem of pion production below the threshold energy from heavy-               ion collisions.  In the present proposal he plans to expand his                 work on this problem by calculating pion production through the                 mechanism of delta-hole and nucleon-hole excitations in                         peripheral nucleus-nucleus calculations.  By including quark                    degrees of freedom in his calculations, he hopes to find quark                  signatures which experimentalists could look for in heavy-ion                   collisions at intermediate to high energies.                                            One of the important fields of nuclear physics is that of               nucleus-nucleus collisions, known as heavy-ion collisions.  In                  these collisions it is possible to produce pi-mesons, also called               pions.  Professor Deutchman has been an important contributor to                the area of pion production below the threshold energy in heavy-                ion collisions.  He has developed useful computer codes for                     computing this process.  He now proposes to expand  his computer                codes to include more physical processes, such as the formation                 of delta particles in the interaction.  Quark degrees of freedom                will also be included.  This research is important in developing                a consistent theory of pion production in heavy-ion collisions                  and may predict quark signatures which could be looked for                      experimentally in intermediate high-energy heavy-ion collisions.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.049,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,10000.00,10000,4900,THEORETICAL PHYSICS,8708068,,Philip A Deutchman,,,,"""""",,,,deutchman@phys.uidaho.edu,Philip,Deutchman,,John Weiner,,,05/26/1987,06/01/1987,11/30/1988,Coherent Pion Production in Heavy-Ion Collisions (Physics),Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,A,,

"The Center for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS) was established in 2007 to address challenges facing the wood products industry, landowners, and managers of the nation's forestland. Over the past decade, the 7 university sites (University of Maine [lead], North Carolina State University, Oregon State University, University of Georgia, Purdue University, University of Idaho, University of Washington) that collaborate under CAFS have successfully provided the structure and resources needed for scientific collaboration in the areas of forest genetics, site manipulation, and growth &amp; yield modeling. As CAFS moves into Phase III, focus will shift to address the technological challenges of the 21st century, with research questions aimed at multiple spatial and temporal scales (including molecular, cellular, individual-tree, stand, and ecosystem levels). Forests provide a major part of the Earth's oxygen, remove and store a substantial amount of atmospheric CO2, provide habitats for much of the world's plants, animals, and microorganisms, serve as feedstock for bioenergy, biofuels, and biomaterials, and are a source of economic opportunity. CAFS regional and national research on a wide range of technological capabilities to sustain healthy forests, with an emphasis on decision-support tools and remote sensing, will support the US forest industry by solving problems with targeted, applied, and collaborative research. <br/><br/>The Center for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS) brings together industry and agency scientists and practitioners and university scientists to solve problems facing our nation's planted and natural forests. CAFS Phase III interdisciplinary research approach will enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. forest products industries by solving problems at multiple temporal and spatial scales, and by determining fundamental solutions that transcend traditional tree species, regional, and disciplinary boundaries. During Phase III, CAFS will focus on precision forest management, forest genetics, key decision-support tools, and remote sensing research. Technology transfer between CAFS scientists and industry will facilitate the adoption of technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), which are rapidly changing how forests are measured, monitored, and managed. CAFS graduate students, recruited from underrepresented and traditional groups, will be unique in the forestry sciences because of their applied problem-solving and interdisciplinary skills across multiple scales. Healthy forests are vital to the world's ecological, social, and economic health; wood is a major economic commodity that serves as the raw material for building and as a feedstock for bioenergy, biofuels, and biomaterials; and 2.7+ million jobs depend on forests, representing a payroll of over $110 billion. CAFS, as the leader for R&amp;D relevant to the forest industry, will directly benefit the national forest economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,"47.041, 47.083",QWYKRJH5NNJ3,500000.00,748578,4900,IUCRC-Indust-Univ Coop Res Ctr,1916699,,Andrew S Nelson,875 Perimeter Dr. MS1133,Moscow,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,mcoleman@uidaho.edu,Mark,Coleman,pbalan@nsf.gov,Prakash Balan,7032925341,"['01002021DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002324DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002425DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002223DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002021DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",12/26/2019,12/15/2019,11/30/2025,Phase III IUCRC at University of Idaho: Center for Advanced Forestry Systems,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Mark J Kimsey'],S,"['Frontiers in Plant Science~2021~12~Moler, Ehren Reid and Nelson, Andrew Steven~https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.741027~~~~~Perspectives on Drought Preconditioning Treatments With a Case Study Using Western Larch~~~10302084~10302084~OSTI~2022-01-28 13:34:52.736~', 'Forest Ecology and Management~2020~474~Chen, Cen and Nelson, Andrew S.~https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118386~~~~~Growth and mortality of planted interior Douglas-fir and western larch seedlings during the establishment phase in Idaho, USA~~118386~10203144~10203144~OSTI~2022-01-28 13:34:52.750~', 'Canadian Journal of Forest Research~2021~51~Heiderman, Ryan R. and Kimsey, Mark J.~https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2020-0426~~~~~A species-specific, site-sensitive maximum stand density index model for Pacific Northwest conifer forests~~1166 to 1177~10302120~10302120~OSTI~2021-11-17 13:03:21.610~', 'New Forests~2022~53~Toca, Andrei and Moler, Ehren and Nelson, Andrew and Jacobs, Douglass F.~https://doi.org/10.1007/s11056-022-09944-8~~~~~Environmental conditions in the nursery regulate root system development and architecture of forest tree seedlings: a systematic review~~1113 to 1143~10382644~10382644~OSTI~2022-12-07 17:42:05.730~', 'New Forests~2022~53~Moler, Ehren R. and Toca, Andrei and Jacobs, Douglass F. and Nelson, Andrew S.~https://doi.org/10.1007/s11056-022-09917-x~~~~~Root system adaptations represent untapped opportunities for forest tree seedling improvement~~1069 to 1091~10382646~10382646~OSTI~2022-12-07 17:42:30.146~', 'Reforesta~2021~12~Vale, Ashley M. and Moler, Ehren R.V. and Nelson, Andrew S.~~~~~~Two studies of the potential of drought preconditioning to enhance deep root production in seedlings of western larch (Larix occidentalis)~~3-12~10384332~10384332~OSTI~2022-12-07 17:39:25.246~', 'Reforesta~2021~12~Vale, Ashleigh M. and Moler, Ehren R.V. and Nelson, Andrew S.~~~~~~Two studies of the potential of drought preconditioning to enhance deep root production in seedlings of western larch (Larix occidentalis)~~3-12~10384372~10384372~OSTI~2022-12-07 21:44:42.840~', 'Natural Resource Modeling~2023~36~Heiderman, Ryan R. and Kimsey, Mark J.~https://doi.org/10.1111/nrm.12381~~~~~Pacific Northwest conifer forest stand carrying capacity under future climate scenarios~~~10476663~10476663~OSTI~2023-11-29 18:10:23.650~']",

"Understanding transient behavior of engineering systems is                      becoming increasingly important in designing, optimizing, and                   controlling high technology products.  As such, engineering                     programs should provide opportunities for undergraduate students                to learn about the significance of dynamic phenomena and the tools              that the engineer uses to examine them.  This plan will focus on                dynamic measurements of phenomena in fluid dynamics and                         hydraulics, vibrations, and combustion engines.  To initiate the                laboratory development plan it is necessary to establish three lab              computer workstations which can perform high speed data                         acquisition, conduct extensive data analysis, and present                       graphical and tabular results in a flexible manner.  These                      workstations will be used to illustrate the theory of dynamic                   instruments discussed in experimental methods courses and will                  allow dynamic phenomena to be routinely studied in undergraduate                laboratory projects.  Possible topics include investigation of                  wing tip vortices on wind tunnel models to gain insight into ways               of controlling the accompanied induced drag, selection of                       structural members with acceptable damping characteristics, and                 comparison of burning rates in diesel engines fired with various                biomass fuels.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,23036.00,23036,4900,CROSS-DIRECTORATE PROGRAMS,8852791,,Ralph S Budwig,,,,"""""",,,,rbudwig@uidaho.edu,Ralph,Budwig,,  name not available,,,12/07/1988,11/15/1988,04/30/1991,Instrumentation for Dynamic Measurements,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,S,,

"An award is made to the University of Idaho to implement a Deep Soil Ecotron facility that will lead to an improved understanding of deep soils, further illuminating the variety of life on the planet, its role in ecosystem processes, and its response to global change. The Deep Soil Ecotron will provide research infrastructure that the US currently lacks, accelerate research on deep soils and the role these soils play in the broader biosphere, and lead to the development of novel technologies aimed at assessing belowground structure and function. Additionally, the Deep Soil Ecotron will serve as the central hub for a network of EPSCoR researchers focused on questions related to deep soils. This national network currently has representatives from nine EPSCoR jurisdictions. Graduate students will be involved in all aspects of the Deep Soil Ecotron. These students, recruited from underrepresented groups, will receive unprecedented training in project management. The project management program, which will include workshops, classes, and hands-on-experience, will generate the future leaders and innovators of infrastructure development in the environmental sciences. Finally, the groundwork for future generations of soil researchers will be laid by expanding an established middle school curriculum development program, where middle school students will design and conduct mini-ecotron experiments. The understanding gained from this facility can help mitigate the degradation of the nation’s soil resources and help address future challenges, thus ensuring soil biodiversity, food security, and climate mitigation capacities for future generations. <br/><br/>Not unlike the deep ocean, little is known about deep soils. Currently, research on deep soils is limited to excavating soil pits, which limits research and experiments that directly manipulate the deep soil environment are currently non-existent. The Deep Soil Ecotron will give researchers the unparalleled ability to investigate deep soils. This facility, composed of twenty-four, highly instrumented ecounits, will allow for soil profiles up to three meters in depth to be repeatedly sampled and continuously monitored. The Deep Soil Ecotron will enable researchers to address the following four broad research needs using approaches and instrumentation which have been unattainable under more common field and laboratory experiments. First, the Deep Soil Ecotron will reveal how deep soil communities and processes affect and interact with surface soils to influence whole ecosystems. Second, the Deep Soil Ecotron will allow researchers to determine how deep soils respond to global and land-use change, such as increasing soil temperature and agricultural management practices. Third, information gained from the Deep Soil Ecotron will be integrated into earth system models to improve model representation. Fourth, the Deep Soil Ecotron will provide a testbed for the development of sensors for the in-situ monitoring of deep soils. Ultimately the Deep Soil Ecotron will be the first of its kind in the world, shedding light on a largely unknown and unexplored environment, and accelerating research on belowground systems.

Dana, Linked to <br/>EPS-0918635 (University of New Mexico) and EPS-0919514 (University of Idaho)<br/><br/>Collaborative Research: Cyberinfrastructure Development for the Western Consortium of Idaho, Nevada, and New Mexico<br/><br/><br/><br/>Idaho, Nevada, and New Mexico have NSF EPSCoR Track-1 Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) awards that share a common theme of global challenge. Collectively, the project teams are studying climate change and its effects on water resources, ecosystems, and the environment. Subsequently, the three states formed a consortium to pursue cyberinfrastructure (CI) improvements that would leverage their resources so that the cumulative impact of NSF RII investments in the three states could exceed the sum of the parts. The impetus for this Track-2 award was the recognition of the complexity and scale of the scientific challenge and subsequent ramifications for science, education, and economic development.<br/><br/>The NV-ID-NM consortium proposed three high priority objectives: 1) to increase connectivity and bandwidth; 2) to enhance data and model interoperability; and 3) to utilize CI to integrate research with education.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>Climate change impacts are especially pronounced in the Western United States due to the tight coupling between climate and regional hydrology, and the associated ramifications for the water supply, disturbance regimes (e.g., fire, drought), regional economy, and the quality of life. The proposed CI developments will enable researchers to more effectively share standardized and interoperable data and models, and to more easily develop regionally coupled atmosphere-land surface-hydrology-socioeconomic models. Consortium institutions and states will be linked to more than 200 other Internet2 universities, government research laboratories, companies, and other research facilities throughout the world to facilitate data-intensive research, collaboration, distributed experiments, grid-based data analysis, experimentation using high performance networking, and social networking. In addition, the proposed investments aim to support effective participation in national and international virtual organizations focused on global climate change, such as the National Ecological Observatory Network, and the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The proposed CI investments in the consortium seek to achieve broad impact and add value by leveraging existing resources and infrastructure within the institutions, jurisdictions, and regions. The institutions that will benefit from the proposed increased connectivity include rural institutions and those serving Hispanic and Native American students and faculty members. Open access to the data and models developed within the consortium will be made available through the data archive, and the model interoperability framework will ensure that scientific products can be broadly disseminated and readily used by scientists, engineers, and students throughout the world. The project also seeks to make usable high-quality environmental data, information, and models available for STEM education and outreach. The consortium?s education programs are designed to have far-reaching impact by: (1) developing new CI skills and climate modeling expertise for graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and faculty; (2) integrating cyberlearning and climate change science into middle and high school science education, especially targeting rural schools and schools that reach Hispanic and Native American students; and (3) developing an Industry CI Days Program that promotes CI awareness in business and industry.<br/><br/>The consortium is committed to improving access to cyberinfrastructure for minority populations and geographically disadvantaged populations, and to increasing diversity in the future workforce of the partnering states. <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.081,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,2000000.00,2000000,4900,EPSCoR Research Infrastructure,0919514,,Lucas J Sheneman,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,sheneman@uidaho.edu,Lucas,Sheneman,jsmall@nsf.gov,Jeanne Small,7032928623,['01000910DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],09/18/2009,09/15/2009,08/31/2013,"Collaborative Research: Cyberinfrastructure Development for the Western Consortium of Idaho, Nevada, and New Mexico",Cooperative Agreement,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,J,"['ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING &amp; SOFTWARE~2011~26~Alexandrov, GA; Ames, D; Bellocchi, G; Bruen, M; Crout, N; Erechtchoukova, M; Hildebrandt, A; Hoffman, F; Jackisch, C; Khaiter, P; Mannina, G; Matsunaga, T; Purucker, ST; Rivington, M; Samaniego, L~10.1016/j.envsoft.2010.08.00~328~336~~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=195294562#000286284700010~Technical assessment and evaluation of environmental models and software: Letter to the Editor~Y~~~~~~', 'OSGeo Journal~2010~8~Marchionni, B. and Ames, D.P.~~54~~~~A Modular Spatial Modeling Environment for GIS~N~~~~~~', 'OSGeo Journal~2010~8~Dunsford, H. and Ames, D.P.~~31~~~~MapWindow 6.0: An Extensible Architecture for Cartographic Symbology~N~~~~~~', 'Transactions in GIS~2010~14(s1)~Kantabutra, V., Owens, J.B., Ames, D.P., Burns, C.N., Stephenson, B.~~39~~~~Using the Newly-Created ILE DBMS to Better Represent Temporal and Historical GIS Data~N~~~~~~', 'Remote Sensing~2013~5~Mitchell, J.J.*, Shrestha, R., Moore-Ellison, C.**, and Glenn, N.F.~10.3390/rs5104857~4857~~~~Single and Multi-date Landsat Classifications of Basalt to Support Soil Survey Efforts~~~~~~~']",
"History: The Flathead Lake Biological Station (FLBS) scientists in Montana have a record of research on ecosystem dynamics in many sites: Glacier-Yellowstone, northern British Columbia, Alaska and Kamchatka. Cooperative work between FLBS and Taylor Wilderness Research Stations in Idaho (TWRS) has developed synergistically: FLBS benefits by access to another site for cooperative studies of river ecology in context of landscape and climate drivers and TWRS benefits by access to advanced ecosystem models, novel remote sensing tools and products and advanced data management tools and protocols. <br/><br/>Project plans: The University of Montana and University of Idaho are awarded a Collaborative Research FSML grant to facilitate field station infrastructure and interinstitutional collaboration building on the strengths of the individual programs and institutions.  The Flathead Lake Biological Station in Montana and the Taylor Wilderness Research Station in Idaho, along with the Yellowstone Ecosystem Research Center (YERC) in Wyoming, are key stations in the region that can address issues of climate and land-use changes on terrestrial and aquatic processes that influence landscape connectivity and biodiversity.  A primary installation will be a distributed-sensor array (RiverNet) in river and riparian systems at the Flathead (Middle Flathead River) and Taylor (Big Creek) Stations that will collect real-time data needed for demonstrating influences of climate and landscape change.  This instrumentation will complement existing infrastructure at YERC.  Aquatic sensors will collect real-time data on water depth, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, NO3 and water temperature.  Riparian sensors will collect data on air temperature, humidity, total solar radiation, PAR and soil moisture and temperature at 20 cm and 50 cm depths.  The design of the distributed sensor networks is the result of university researchers and engineers and instrument specialists at Cisco Systems Inc., a partner in this program.<br/><br/>The Taylor Wilderness Research Station will augment its power infrastructure to facilitate data acquisition from instruments, sensor arrays and computer operations through a combination of new solar arrays (43 kWh/day) and a microhydro turbine (50 kWh/day).<br/><br/>The Flathead Lake Biological Station will remodel its Freshwater Research Lab to facilitate analyses and data management from the RiverNet arrays by reworking the existing entrance areas to create office and lab space for RiverNet analysts, construct a secure server room, and connect lighting and servers to an existing emergency generator.  All remodeling includes energy-efficient lighting and heating systems.  <br/><br/>This infrastructure represents the first step toward development of a research coordination network in the region that is characterized by large federally protected areas (National Parks and wildernesses) embedded in complex mosaics of mountain and range habitats with steep elevational and latitudinal gradients of temperature and precipitation.  Large blocks of roadless areas, coupled with largely undeveloped river bottoms of the upstream segments of three great rivers of North America (Columbia, Missouri, Saskatchewan), provide linkage corridors that have important ecological and economic functions that maintain the natural and cultural attributes of the regional landscape.  However, the entire region is undergoing environmental and economic change as agricultural and forest lands convert to exurban uses and climate warming reduces snowpacks and lengthens growing seasons.  The coordinated research empowered by the awarded infrastructure will add to an understanding of how natural processes are affected in this changing world and help inform the inevitable debate on how society should react to the potential threats.  The field stations involved have strong educational programs and are of great interest to the general public as representative of wilderness and wildland areas.  Increasing station capabilities with this award will help recruit students and provide knowledge on environmental change needed in educational curricula.

"This workshop is focused on exploring the feasibility of a Regional Native American Graduate Research Center.  The workshop will engage a diverse group of stakeholders in Native American education, training, and research from the Northwest region, and from the broader U.S.  Participants in this collaborative process will include leaders from Native American tribes and inter-tribal organizations in the Northwest, representatives from Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCU) across the western U.S., representatives from NSF-sponsored Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) and Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) projects, and administrators and faculty from the University of Idaho (UI) and other majority institutions in the western U.S. that have strong Native American programs.<br/><br/>The workshop will explore creative, original, and potentially transformative concepts that could, in the long term, become a model for Native American graduate education, improving STEM degree attainment and strengthening the workforce.  A goal of the workshop is to create a consensus vision for a magnet center for Native American graduate students to engage in research relevant to their cultural backgrounds and interests.  Such an interdisciplinary center would feature research opportunities in natural resources, health, education, law and policy, and economics.  On the education side, such a center would develop holistic curricula that reflect the integrated world view of Native Americans, such as forest science in the context of ecosystems, with relation to tribal health, lifestyle, law and policy.<br/><br/>Workshop topics will include discussion on the needs of each tribe represented; discussion with the TCUs represented on what has been successful with graduating their students in STEM fields, and discussion on best practices for transitioning baccalaureate STEM graduates into graduate degree programs; discussion on research opportunities, their relevance to tribal needs, and identification of natural partners; presentation by Native American graduate students from various institutions on what has and has not worked, and what a center could do for them and their successors; a culture discussion on how a center could transform the experience of Native American graduate students; an education discussion on integration within existing curricula and new curricula; and discussion on follow-on activities, including exploration into sources of funding for a center.  Discussions will be led by a facilitator, and the workshop will include an evaluation component.  A final report will assimilate information from the workshop and follow-on activities, and is expected to include an initial roadmap for a center and identification of potential funding sources.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.083,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,99562.00,99562,4900,EPSCoR Research Infrastructure,0836495,,Arthur Taylor,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,ataylor@uidaho.edu,Arthur,Taylor,jsmall@nsf.gov,Jeanne Small,7032928623,['01000809DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],09/08/2008,09/15/2008,08/31/2010,Planning Workshop for a Regional Native American Graduate Research Center,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Marcos E Galindo', 'Margrit von Braun']",,,
"The University of Idaho (UofI) continues its participation in the Scholarship for Service (SFS) program. The driving motive behind this project is the continued need to train Information Assurance (IA) professionals for entry into the federal workforce. By grouping students from multiple disciplines into the same labs and seminars the UofI SFS program provides a diversity and synergy that enables participants to appreciate the multifaceted aspects of IA, including perspectives from software, hardware, and management. The purpose of this project is predominately educational rather than research, so the project activities lie mostly in the preparation of students to enter the IA workforce. In the UofI SFS program the IA scholars have hands-on laboratory experiences with a variety of network configurations including reconfigurable attack-defend scenarios, real-time embedded systems, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Through these laboratories the IA scholars gain the knowledge and insights that enable them to design and implement more secure and survivable systems. Ultimately, this program is contributing to both improving society and providing benefits to a diverse student body. For society we would have more stable information infrastructures when they are designed and operated by individuals with an understanding of information assurance.

These goals are aligned with the goals of the Whitehouse's Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI), the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014, and DHS and NSF CyberCorps(R) program's goals.  The University of Idaho CyberCorps(R) SFS program started in 2001 and has been renewed in 2006 and 2010.  Our program has an excellent record of achievement and has had a nearly 100% graduate full-time employment rate for the last 10 years (one student was excused due to unexpected health problems).  The University of Idaho has been a NSA/DHS National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance/Cybersecurity Education (CAE/IAE) since 1999.  The university's cybersecurity education program has been recently recertified CAE/IAE from 2014 until 2021. In addition, the covered academic programs are ABET accredited.  Graduates from the UI CyberCorps(R) SFS program have a foundational knowledge strongly rooted in mathematics and scientific theory, a practical skillset learned through hands-on laboratories, and a research-oriented innovative approach to problem solving. Just as important, our graduates have developed the presentation, communication, and management skills necessary to be effective in the workforce. Anecdotally we have received comments from employers that our students are very knowledgeable and fit well into their respective teams.  For this particular award, funded from through 2017, we supported 18 students. Ten of these received their BS degree in computer science. Of those, 6 went on to complete an MS degree as well.  Of the 8 graduate students, 6 were MS students and 2 were PhD students. All students are currently meeting SFS employment obligations with Federal Agencies or National Labs (except one student who was excused due to unexpected severe health problems).   Our program underwent change during the period of this award, due to departure of several faculty. We scaled back our numbers of SFS students per year to ensure adequate one-on-one mentoring for our students.  We have hired replacement faculty, and the program is growing again.

"This project aims to significantly enhance post-award research administration by developing open-source tools that integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and data science. Research administration is crucial for supporting scientific progress, but many institutions face challenges with inefficient processes that hinder their ability to effectively manage grants and contracts. Recent advances in generative AI provide a unique opportunity to augment research administrators' capabilities. By creating accessible, innovative tools, this project will help level the playing field for emerging research institutions, minority-serving institutions, and primarily undergraduate institutions. Improved research administration will accelerate scientific discovery across disciplines by reducing the administrative burden on researchers, allowing them to focus more on their work. The project will also contribute to workforce development by training research administrators in data science and AI skills, preparing them for the increasingly technological future of the field. By making these tools open source, the project promotes collaboration and innovation in the broader research management ecosystem. <br/><br/>The project has three main objectives: 1) Develop open-source data models and workflows that adhere to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles to improve data accessibility and interoperability in research administration. 2) Create trustworthy AI-powered tools to automate manual processes, reduce errors, and augment the capabilities of research administrators. These will include natural language processing and machine learning models for tasks like data extraction, compliance verification, and decision support. All tools will undergo rigorous testing for accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility. 3) Implement and assess the impact of these tools at partner institutions, starting with the University of Idaho and Southern Utah University, then expanding to additional collaborators. The project will use an iterative, user-centered development approach, incorporating feedback from partners to ensure the tools meet real-world needs. Importantly, the project features an independent external evaluator to ensure the research administration community can learn from both successes and challenges, a critical approach given the rapid advancements in AI capabilities. By integrating data science and AI in a thoughtful, tested manner, this project aims to create a transformative framework for efficient, data-driven research administration that can be adopted widely across diverse institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.083,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,4546903.00,4546903,4900,GRANTED,2427549,,Sarah S Martonick,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,smartonick@uidaho.edu,Sarah,Martonick,dstroud@nsf.gov,Dina Stroud,7032925015,['01002425DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],09/10/2024,09/15/2024,08/31/2029,Crossing the Innovation Valley of Death: Democratizing Data and Artificial Intelligence for Research Administration,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Lucas J Sheneman', 'Barrie Robison', 'Sylvia Bradshaw']",S,,
"This project addresses the urgent problems caused by hazardous industrial waste and climate change, disproportionately affecting low-income and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) communities due to social and economic inequality. It aims to transform biomass and hazardous industrial wastes into inexpensive, green construction materials using Negative Emission Technology (NET). This approach promotes environmental justice and enhances resilience to climate-related issues. By incorporating CO2 into building materials from waste, the project reduces atmospheric carbon levels and provides a sustainable waste management solution. It also provides a long-term solution for handling biomass and industrial waste, which is presently disposed in landfills and causes health issues. The project also intends to create better building materials by combining pozzolanic reactivity, CO2 capture and mineralization, which will speed up scientific and technological advancement. It fosters diversity and education by involving researchers from one Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in Alabama and three public universities in New Mexico, Alabama, and Idaho. Comprehensive workforce development programs include early career faculty development, undergraduate and graduate training, K–12 education, and teacher training, supporting STEM jobs and education in underrepresented areas. Benefits include better public health from reduced hazardous waste, safer housing options, and improved well-being through economic opportunities and infrastructure enhancement in the targeted communities.<br/><br/>The Fifth National Climate Assessment highlights the vulnerability of low-income and BIPOC communities in Alabama, Idaho, and New Mexico to climate change and land-filled hazardous industrial wastes. In response, a collaborative effort involving four institutions from these EPSCoR jurisdictions aims to develop a novel pathway to alleviate these effects. The project revolves around a Negative Emission Technology (NET) designed to convert alkaline industrial and biomass wastes into low-cost, low-carbon construction materials. This transformative solution provides an economically viable means of enhancing the climate resilience of these communities and sequestering CO2 into concrete. Using alkaline industrial wastes as feedstock, the process produces calcium-rich leachate for CO2 capture, creating CaCO3 precipitate. The filtered solid residual, with higher pozzolanic reactivity, can partially replace ordinary Portland cement in concrete. This method generates new revenues and addresses climate change through carbon capture and utilization in concrete. It is estimated that the NET method could sequester 2.9-8.5 billion tonnes of CO2 per year by 2100. The project is a consortium of researchers from The University of Alabama, University of New Mexico, University of Idaho, and Alabama A&amp;M University, a Historically Black College and University. The diverse team includes nine assistant professors. Workforce development and outreach activities are extensive, covering K-12 education for teachers, undergraduate students, early career professors, industry partners, and communities. These initiatives promote STEM education in sustainable construction materials, circular economy practices, and the emerging interdisciplinary field of decarbonization of the built environment, directly benefiting the targeted low-income and BIPOC communities. This project is funded by the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement-Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (RII-FEC) program. The RII-FEC program builds inter-jurisdictional collaborative teams of EPSCoR investigators in focus areas consistent with the NSF Strategic Plan. RII-FEC projects include researchers from at least two EPSCoR eligible jurisdictions with complementary expertise and resources necessary to address challenges, which neither party could address as well or as rapidly independently.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.083,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,1005042.00,514516,4900,EPSCoR RII Track-2 FEC,2418356,,Armando G McDonald,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,armandm@uidaho.edu,Armando,McDonald,jcolom@nsf.gov,Jose Colom,7032927088,['01002425DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/22/2024,09/15/2024,08/31/2028,"Collaborative Research: RII FEC: Transforming wastes Into Economic Assets for Sustainability, Resilience, and Prosperity by a Novel Negative Emission Technology",Cooperative Agreement,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,G,,

"The project will provide computationally efficient statistical methods that explain genetic polymorphism affected by mutation, selection and genetic drift. Statistical analysis of this type of genetic data is complicated and computationally intensive. The new approach considered here combines methods from several mathematical disciplines.  Techniques from numerical analysis, such as fast-Fourier transforms, make the proposed algorithms much faster than current methods. Stochastic approaches that efficiently simulate data provide a more reliable assessment of the methodology.  <br/><br/>Many of the current methods for uncovering the genetic basis of complex diseases in humans aim to exploit the relationships between genes at loci close together on the same chromosome. These patterns depend crucially on the genetic variation at the loci involved. Consequently, there is considerable interest in understanding how these would be affected by selection. Additionally, this project will develop widely accessible, reliable software for analyzing genetic polymorphism in a way that will assess the impact of selection. Training will be provided to a graduate student who will be part of a newly formed interdisciplinary graduate program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) at the University of Idaho. This future scientist will leave the program with dramatically different training than the student's advisor. By being on the boundary of several disciplines, the student will be on the cutting edge of the future of computational biology.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,0.00,282000,4900,POPULATION DYNAMICS,0515738,,Paul Joyce,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,joyce@uidaho.edu,Paul,Joyce,,Nancy J.

"Quantum computers can perform calculations much faster and with less energy than classical computers. However, they generally require extremely low operating temperature, noise, and humidity conditions and large device footprints. Conjugated organic molecules, such as dyes, that absorb and emit light are potential candidates for room-temperature quantum computing due to their unique optical properties. The design of such dyes requires efficient high-throughput screening. A new autonomous molecular design cyberinfrastructure (CI) is developed for forward and inverse de novo materials designs. Forward design discovers the most predictive features for a target property or performance called the latent space. Inverse design predicts an optimal structure or compositions leveraging the latent space, given the desired properties and / or performance. The technologies developed in this project are integrated into a STEM education effort through course module development, and participation in the Democratizing Data Science for Climate Resiliency and Social Mobility (ClimB) project - a modular, fully online, automated, and personalized data science certificate program – and a series of K-12 outreach activities. The project aligns well with NSF’s 10 Big Ideas.<br/><br/>The project goal is to develop a visual artificial intelligence (AI)- and knowledge-driven machine learning (ML) toolkit (MatFlow) for multi-source and multi-formatted data analysis capable of both forward and inverse designs. Research objectives are to: (1) conduct ab-initio density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TD) DFT to generate dye structure-property datasets; (2) create a visual CI toolkit using a user-friendly graphical interface to conduct both forward and inverse dye designs; (3) validate and test the CI toolkit by primary end users; and (4) expand end-user communities beyond quantum computing. The developed CI accelerates and advances the exploration of new molecular science and broadens the interface of organic chemistry with quantum physics, materials science, biochemistry, biophysics, computer science, and data science.<br/><br/>This award by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Directorate for STEM Education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,"47.049, 47.070, 47.076",QWYKRJH5NNJ3,299838.00,299838,4900,"Chem Thry, Mdls & Cmptnl Mthds",2410668,,Hasan M Jamil,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,jamil@uidaho.edu,Hasan,Jamil,dmassey@nsf.gov,Daniel F.

"The goal of the project is to explore Land education pedagogy and its curriculum and pedagogical innovations in the preparation of Native and non-Native educators to engage Native and non-Native students in environmental STEM education on Indigenous lands. The investigator will implement a professional development plan focused on pedagogical innovations within various teacher education and environmental STEM learning programs to (a) understand the tools and technologies that can support these innovations and (b) develop new research methods for understanding the impact of these innovations on individuals, communities, and socio-ecological systems. The research  builds on the investigator’s prior inquiries on culturally connected identity and how technology can be used to deepen observation skills and communicate to broader audiences while not distracting from students’ engagement. The project will advance this knowledge and build new collaboration through network engagement.  <br/><br/>The research project uses the Actor Network Theory and Critical Indigenous Research Methodologies to frame the research design and approach. There are four driving questions: (1) What affordances does Land education pedagogy offer in creating inclusive and epistemologically diverse STEM learning environments, building more equitable relationships to particular places and to socio-ecological systems, and impacting the diversity of the STEM workforce? (2) What tools and technologies can assist in sustaining long-term, mutually beneficial relationships to support the preparation of Native and non-Native educators who will engage in educational strategies that lead to diverse STEM workforce on indigenous lands? (3) What are the impacts of a Land education pedagogy on individual students’ sense of belonging and STEM identity, communities of educators’ approaches to STEM engagement, and the health of broader socio-ecological systems?  Data will be collected from K-12 and graduate students using autoethnographies, photovoice and symbol-based reflections, observations, and network mapping. Evidence will be analyzed using content and discourse analysis.  The research findings will inform programs that employ Land education pedagogy to shape more equitable and inclusive environmental STEM education for students and teachers and to increase STEM persistence among underrepresented populations.<br/><br/>The project is funded by the Mid-Career Advancement Program that enables scientists and engineers to substantively advance their research program and career trajectory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.076,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,227519.00,227519,4900,ECR:BCSER Capcity STEM Ed Rscr,2121898,,Karla Eitel,Office of Sponsored Programs,MOSCOW,US,ID00,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838443020,kbradley@uidaho.edu,Karla,Eitel,anixon@nsf.gov,Andrea Nixon,7032922321,['04002122DB NSF Education & Human Resource'],09/07/2021,09/15/2021,08/31/2025,MCA: Partnering Land and communities for equitable and inclusive STEM learning,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,,
"Disproportionate importance of edge habitat for ecosystem functioning in deep oligotrophic lakes<br/>Stephanie E. Hampton, University of Idaho<br/>NSF Starter Grant (0528531), 3 August 2005<br/><br/>Human activities greatly alter many aspects of lakeshores; in particular, nutrients from fertilizers and sewage can encourage nuisance algae, and tree removal can decrease shading as well as reduce the number of insects that fall to the water surface where they are eaten by lake animals. While the lakeshore may constitute a relatively tiny area of the lake disturbed by humans, this nearshore area frequently may be the most critical habitat for breeding and feeding by fish and other animals.  Here the importance of nearshore environments will be evaluated through examination of naturally occurring stable isotopes in tissues from lake animals and plants; carbon isotopes can indicate whether growth is mainly supported by nearshore or open water food resources, and nitrogen isotopes relate to an organism's position in the ""food chain"".  Stable isotopes can also help differentiate among different nutrient pollutants that fuel growth of nuisance algae, such that managers can more effectively target monitoring and control. <br/><br/>Disturbance to the shoreline can affect ecosystem functioning long before the rest of the lake appears polluted. Managers increasingly call for controls on nearshore pollution, although lake-wide consequences of localized disturbances are not yet well understood. This research will provide critical information on the role of nearshore environments in structuring plant and animal communities and help prioritize management and conservation efforts in lakes.  <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,40000.00,40000,4900,ECOSYSTEM STUDIES,0528531,,Stephanie E Hampton,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,shampton@carnegiescience.edu,Stephanie,Hampton,,Martyn M.

"A collaborative team of investigators from Michigan State University and the University of Idaho is working with instructors and students in interdisciplinary environmental science programs (IESPs) to conduct systematic, critical analysis of ethical concepts in the context of interdisciplinary environmental science. IESPs have multiplied in post-secondary and graduate curricula in response to pressing environmental problems. Ethical considerations are of immense importance in addressing environmental topics, because they often involve value judgments and the ethical issues involved are complex, multi-faceted, and high-stakes. Yet, ethics education materials for graduate IESP courses have not kept pace. This education and research project is developing an approach to graduate ethics education in IESPs that can better prepare the next generation of environmental scientists to solve complex problems. Materials development is being guided by two pedagogical commitments: (a) a constructivist paradigm that recognizes the social and collaborative nature of learning; and (b) a commitment to problem-driven models of education. A structured, yet flexible, framework is being created to enable development of course modules that can subsequently be adopted for use in classroom dialogue, building on results of work previously funded by NSF (the Toolbox Project - NSF award #0823058). The framework consists of materials for instructors and students that help them identify contexts in their IESP where ethical dilemmas generated by value judgments are likely to occur. The framework has two dimensions, corresponding to ""content"" and ""method"". The ""content"" concerns value judgments that relate to (a) the conduct of interdisciplinary scientific research, and (b) the impact of interdisciplinary environmental science on societal needs and policies. The ""method"" engages students, as teams or groups, in critical, conceptual analysis of value and policy aspects of their own practice as scientists and engineers. Students in courses using these modules will participate actively in identifying and assessing values-related challenges that are at the intersection of multiple environmental perspectives and at the intersection of science with policy. In addition to developing this framework, the project team is conducting a rigorous evaluation of its effectiveness for facilitating better consideration of ethical issues in IESP courses. Dissemination of the framework broadly through presentations and publications will strengthen interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate education and will also provide professional development opportunities, ethics training, and mentoring for graduate research assistants.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.075,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,103241.00,103241,4900,EESE,1338626,,Troy E Hall,,Mosow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838441139,troy.hall@oregonstate.edu,Troy,Hall,wbauchsp@nsf.gov,Wenda K.

Fundamentally, our approach is to couple the energy of two mechanical systems using reversible piezoelectric transducers connected with a passive electric circuit. The coupling is designed in such a way to use existing energy to cancel or reduce unwanted vibrations and/or sound radiation.  Two arrangements are being considered: transfer of vibration energy from one structure to another, and transfer of vibration energy from one mode to another on a single structure.  The first case employs a linear connecting circuit, while the latter employs a nonlinear connecting circuit to couple the energy. Mathematical models and solutions for four test cases are being developed and compared with experimental results.  Holographic full-field measurements are used to determine the effectiveness of the method.  This general approach is an improvement over a passive shunt technique in that the typically heavy electrical shunt is replaced with an existing mechanical component. It also has the advantage over active control techniques in that an external power source is not required.  The primary impact of this work is that a new approach to the control of vibrations and acoustic radiation from structures will be developed. Reductions in system weight, cost, and complexity compared to current methods can be realized.<br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,235647.00,235647,4900,DYNAMICS & CONTROL,9978825,,Tony J Anderson,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,tandersn@uidaho.edu,Tony,Anderson,,Shih-Chi Liu,,,09/08/1999,09/15/1999,08/31/2002,Passive Vibration Suppression Using Nonlinear Electro-Mechanical Coupling,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Michael J Anderson', 'Jonathan D Blotter']",J,,

"Determining the frequency and impact of hybridization during animal speciation remains a central issue in evolutionary biology. This project will investigate hybridization and the evolution of chipmunks in western North America. Chipmunks represent an excellent study system due to their obvious segregation into distinct habitats, and resulting narrow zones of contact between species. In addition, they are characterized by differentiation of reproductive anatomy between species, suggesting reproductive isolation. The investigators have identified numerous instances where gene flow occurs between ecologically and anatomically distinct species, suggesting hybridization may be important during the evolution of this and other groups. The investigators will test predictions of divergence with gene flow using population-level genetic markers and will also estimate a phylogeny of the genus using a diverse array of molecular data sets. <br/><br/>This project represents a collaboration between an EPSCoR-supported research university and a large public natural history museum, thus providing numerous opportunities for the dissemination of information to the scientific community and the general public.

"The University of Idaho and Washington State University are awarded a Water, Sustainability and Climate Type 1 award to develop the organizing framework for a systematic assessment of urbanization and its impacts on water in the Spokane, Washington-Coeur d'Alene, Idaho Corridor.  The framework is grounded in collaboration between scientists and the local communities in the area. The principal goal of the award will be to accomplish an improved understanding of linkages between human dimensions and water resources as a coupled human-natural system. This will be based on accessing and assessing existing data and models, and adding essential new social science data to refine, integrate, and optimize established models. Optimization models will develop scenarios that can be evaluated and adopted by policy and decision makers in the communities of the Spokane-Coeur d'Alene Corridor.  A systems approach will be used in this project to address the complex intersection of water resources and human activity including climate dynamics, water quantity/quality, landscape dynamics, distributed and renewable energy, social/economic factors, cultural and demographic change, natural resource law, built environment/engineering infrastructure, transportation planning/policies, urban-wildland/agriculture interface, and new threats from changing environments (e.g., wildfire impacts, invasive species).  The work that will be accomplished will be performed by researchers from the University of Idaho and Washington State University and the state, federal, city, county and tribal institutions that acquire data and are responsible for the management of their resources and communities.<br/><br/>The award will build an education and engagement program that involves partners and core stakeholders in the collaborative effort.

The framework is grounded in an organized process of collaboration between scientists and the SCC communities. Extensive meetings with researchers and stakeholders in the communities of the area identified water as the principal factor in sustainability issues because it touches every aspect of the basin system. The systems approach used in this incubation proposal addressed water resources broadly: climate dynamics, water quantity/quality, landscape dynamics, distributed and renewable energy, social/economic factors, cultural and demographic change, natural resource law, built environment/engineering infrastructure, transportation planning/policies, urban-wildland/agriculture interface, and new threats from changing environments (e.g., wildfire impacts, invasive species). Therefore, many additional disciplines were included to address the core efforts for water budgets, built water systems, and linkages among myriad processes to develop theoretical frameworks, models and future scenarios. The principal goal of the WSC Incubation proposal was to improve the understanding of linkages between human dimensions and water resources as a coupled human-natural system.

"The project will be a ?proof of concept? for a new instrument platform called the Autonomous Arctic Infrared Observer (AAIRO). The primary goal is to assess the value of data products retrieved from simulated AAIRO measurements relative to instruments that are currently deployed as part of the ICECAPS experiment. [ICECAPS stands for Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state, and Precipitation at Summit.] A computer model will be developed that simulates the operation of the AAIRO by degrading the spectral resolution of spectra from the Polar Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (P-AERI) deployed at Summit, Greenland. Algorithms will be used to retrieve atmospheric properties from the simulated AAIRO spectra. Retrieved properties will include near-surface temperature structure, trace gas amounts of water vapor, carbon monoxide, and methane, and macrophysical (fraction, base height) and microphysical properties (phase, effective particle radius, optical depth) of clouds. Retrieved properties from the AAIRO simulator will be compared to those retrieved from the suite of ICECAPS instruments. This project will prove the usefulness of the AAIRO as a complementary instrument within the broader context of NSF?s Arctic Observing Network and will set the stage for future development of the actual AAIRO instrument.

The AAIRO would be an infrared spectrometer, which measures the infrared radiance emitted by gases and clouds in the atmosphere. From such measurements, it is possible to retrieve total column amounts of greenhouse gases and properties of clouds, including cloud height and microphysical properties such as particle size, thickness, and whether they are comprised of liquid or ice. The work has broader impacts for climate, since these greenhouse gas and cloud properties have an important impact on climate, particularly in the Arctic, which has shown enhanced sensitivity to climate change.  Infrared spectrometers are currently in use to retrieve trace gas amounts and cloud properties, but current instruments typically require significant infrastructure. The proof of concept is for an instrument that would be rugged and portable, but this would necessarily involve trade-offs in instrument design that might lead to lower accuracy of retrievals. One example is instrument signal-to-noise: a more rugged instrument would likely have lower signal-to-noise. This can be improved through reducing the instrument spectral resolution (which allows more infrared radiation to enter the instrument). This work explores the feasibility and accuracy of retrievals for different instrument resolutions.  A simplified model demonstrating how atmospheric scientists retrieve cloud properties was developed and is available online as an educational tool for classroom use, representing a broader impact of this work.  The intellectual merit involves the following findings. It was found that the accuracy of cloud microphysical property retrievals is unaffected by spectral resolution (to resolutions as coarse as 4 cm-1) but resolution does limit the set of clouds for which cloud height can be accurately retrieved to thicker, higher clouds, and limits the accuracy of gas retrievals. For this reason, it was decided that the instrument should allow for variable resolution between that typically used for such retrievals (0.5 cm-1) and 4 cm-1.  In addition to the planned objectives, as work proceeded a number of new avenues of interest opened up. One concerns the complex refractive index (CRI) of liquid water, which determines how liquid clouds absorb and emit infrared radiation. Measurements indicate that the CRI depends on temperature, but this dependence is generally ignored.  We found that this temperature dependence causes cold liquid clouds to have a greater greenhouse effect than previously believed. Because of the importance of this finding, a new set of temperature-dependent CRIs was made available online and the temperature dependence was incorporated into a database of simulated infrared spectra that have been shared with the community. This database will allow the atmospheric science community to explore how Arctic clouds influence atmospheric radiation.  Another example concerns the interplay between the greenhouse effects of water vapor and clouds. We find that the cold and dry conditions of the Arctic, combined with humidity trends projected by global climate models, imply an increased sensitivity to clouds in a warming Arctic. This could have important consequences if Arctic clouds are modified through natural variation or anthropogenic influence.  Additional work demonstrated the utility of an AAIRO instrument.  A paper was published in which data similar to what the proposed instrument could provide was compared to reanalysis data (which combines measurements and forecasts), using a technique called wavelet analysis. The results indicate that the reanalysis data underestimates the thickness of Arctic clouds; the proposed instrument would help improve this data by providing additional measurements of Arctic clouds. This finding demonstrates th..."

"In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jakob Magolan of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Idaho will develop a unique class of synthetic methods that rely on the merger of heterogeneous catalysts and reagents with one-pot multi-step approaches.  Some of these methods will utilize site-isolation, a unique property of insoluble reagents that enables the co-existence of seemingly incompatible reactive sites (such as acids and bases) in the same reaction mixture.  This strategy, which remains largely unexplored by the synthetic community, will be exploited to achieve unusual one-pot synthetic transformations.  New tandem concurrent heterogeneous catalysis strategies will be applied to a range of chemical transformations including reductive amination, aromatic amination, synthesis of 1,3-diketones, crossed aldols, and efficient preparation of several common heterocyclic motifs.  <br/><br/>One pot multistep reactions could have significant advantages in reducing waste generation and costs in chemical synthesis, as they minimize the number of isolation steps that are labor intensive and often generate a significant amount of waste solvents. Site isolation can also lead to reactivities that are difficult to achieve.  These strategies are broadly applicable for use in the synthesis of a wide variety of compounds that are of interests to the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industries.  The development of green chemistry themed experiments utilizing heterogeneous tools for use in undergraduate teaching laboratories is also planned.  This project will provide excellent training of graduate and undergraduate students.

We employed heterogeneous (insoluble) reagents including clays, silicas, and aluminas to enhance the efficiency of synthetic procedures by simplifying the purification of reaction products.  During the course of this project our research team at the University of Idaho investigated fourteen new reaction methodology strategies that included all of the aims described in the original research proposal and several further aims that arose during the course of this work.   We found that our initial proposed strategy of concurrent heterogeneous site-isolated acid/base catalysis for one-pot sequential multi-step synthetic transformations proved to be generally plagued by problems of poor selectivity and product yields.   We were successful in the development of two heterogeneous reactions that are now published in peer-reviewed journals: 1) a new dehydroaromatization reaction enabled by vanadium pentoxide in the presence of silica gel, and 2) a new selective carbonyl reaction made possible by the use of rehydrated alumina.  The latter was the first example of alumina rehydration as a strategy to modulate the regioselectivity of a synthetic process.  Several projects initiated by this program are ongoing in our laboratory with publications forthcoming.  These include: alumina-mediated alkylation of heterocycles with enones, alumina-mediated olefin epoxidation, and a series of transformations enabled by a new synthetic iron-rich clay.  This NSF grant also directly, and indirectly, supported an extensive training program in our laboratory that exposed many University of Idaho students to a vibrant and inspirational synthetic organic chemistry research environment.  These students included two graduate students who both completed their Ph.D. degrees and eight undergraduate students whose training in our lab enabled them to subsequently join strong graduate programs in chemistry across the United where they continue to grow as skilled and knowledgeable researchers dedicated to the pursuit of impactful science.

"9411008  JANKOWSKI       Locational conflicts arise when different people or groups  give different weights to various factors when deciding where to  locate facilities or resources.  The development of spatial  decision-support systems (SDSSs) for use within geographic  information systems (GISs) has offered new approaches for solving  spatial problems and making locational decisions.  Knowledge of  the benefits and limitations of such systems is limited by a  paucity of conceptual and empirical critiques of their use,  however.  This collaborative research project will provide  insights into the use of a SDSS for groups in order to understand  how and why such a group system affects decision-making processes  and outcomes.  Special attention will be given to analysis of  that ways that several thematic map types and multi-criteria  decision models influence the dynamics of, and are influenced by,  small-group interactions for site-location decisions.  In  laboratory experiments of small groups with five participants  within each group, graduate students from environmentally related  programs will select sites for habitat restoration and  development in the wake of toxic-waste cleanup projects.  Participants will function in a group-based software environment  created from a combination of commercial and public-domain  software.  Interaction-coding techniques will be used to compile  data from transcripts of the interaction process in order to  ascertain how SDSS approaches affect group decision making.       This project will contribute valuable new insights into the  dynamics of collaborative decision making and the use of  information technology by adding substantive knowledge about  multi-phase group decision-making processes.  It will apply and  refine an interaction-coding scheme to develop a knowledge base  that other technology-based studies of collaborative spatial  decision making can use, and it will develop a more complete  understanding of the integration needs for information tech nology  that involves GISs, multi-criteria decision models, and SDSSs for  groups.

"The objective of this project is to improve the understanding of phosphorous storage and use in wheat and barley seeds.  Approximately 75% of the phosphorous in wheat and barley seeds is in the form of phytic acid, which makes the phosphorous unavailable in diets of humans, poultry, swine, and fish.  As a consequence, much of the phosphorous consumed is excreted, which  creates a significant environmental problem in animal waste management.  Moreover, humans consuming a primarily grain-based diet may suffer mineral<br/>deficiencies because of the ability of phytic acid to form tightly-bound complexes with minerals.  The enzymes involved in phytic acid accumulation in seeds are  not fully characterized.  Low phytic acid wheat and barley selections have  been identified.  Using these mutants and techniques of genetic analysis,  this project will further the understanding of this important metabolic  process in cereal seeds.  The goal is to identify, clone, and  characterize genes associated with the synthesis of phytic acid and related  phosphorous biochemical pathways (specifically inositol monophosphatase and  inositol kinase), to better understand this pathway's role in plant biology,  and ultimately to improve world grain crops to reduce animal-derived  phosphorous pollution and improve mineral nutrition of humans and  domesticated livestock.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,450000.00,450000,4900,,0110748,,Edward Souza,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,esouza@uidaho.edu,Edward,Souza,,Parag R.

"This IGERT award will establish an interdisciplinary, multi-institution graduate research and education program in conservation biology and sustainability of agricultural and forest systems.  The need is acute for better disciplinary integration to achieve biodiversity conservation and sustainable productivity in anthropogenically fragmented landscapes.  To achieve this, a new generation of professionals must be educated in a holistic fashion.  Students in this program will work in interdisciplinary teams to study aspects of biodiversity conservation and sustainable productivity in three distinct geographic regions characterized by habitat fragmentation.  A highly productive group of educators and researchers from three Colleges and seven Departments at the University of Idaho and four Research Areas at the Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center (CATIE), an international institution headquartered in Costa Rica, will participate in the project.  These faculty will provide mentoring in agricultural ecology, forest ecology and management, conservation biology and biodiversity assessment, ecological genetics, soil science, watershed sciences, ethics, rural sociology, policy, social impact assessment, and environmental economics.  The IGERT program will differ from traditional doctoral programs at UI in five major ways.  First, graduate education will be multi-institutional with course work conducted at UI and CATIE, and dual-institution graduate committee membership.  Second, student teams will address similar research questions in temperate and tropical ecosystems and will complete a research internship with their teammates in the country that is not their primary field site.  Third, students working in interdisciplinary teams will produce dissertation sets that will include some co-authored chapters.  Fourth, students will complete an interdisciplinary graduate curriculum including biophysical and social sciences.  Fifth, students will participate in professional development activities including joint annual research symposia and interdisciplinary training workshops.  Special efforts are planned to recruit Hispanic, Native American, and African American students.  Professionals educated through this program will have the expertise to work effectively in interdisciplinary teams addressing the pressing scientific problems concerning management of the biosphere.  Students will gain cross-cultural experience and geographic exposure to enhance their international perspective.  These professionals will be uniquely prepared to pursue careers in academia, government agencies, and international research and development institutions.<br/><br/>IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future.

"Glaciers and ice sheets are rapidly shrinking, with implications for local water resources, biogeochemical properties of streams, rivers, fjords, and oceans, and global sea level rise. As air temperatures warm, melting water from glaciers can be transported to the base of the glaciers where the ice meets the bedrock below. The addition of this water has caused dramatic acceleration of ice flow for some glaciers, small flow changes in others, and even deceleration for other glaciers. Changes in ice flow can be dramatic and unstable, leading to rapid glacier loss that cannot be predicted using current ice flow models. This project aims to better understand the links between glacier hydrology and ice flow by studying an event called a glacier surge during which the ice flow increases dramatically for a period of a few years. The project will conduct an integrated field, remote sensing, and modeling study of a glacier surge at Turner Glacier in Southeast Alaska. The scientific insights gained here will have broad applicability across glacier and ice sheet conditions in many parts of the Arctic and Antarctic, reducing uncertainties in predictions of global glacier loss in the coming decades. The project will strengthen the glacier research programs at Idaho’s two largest universities through interdisciplinary inclusive research, outreach, and community building. <br/><br/>The project will collect in-situ seismic, radar, geodetic, meteorological, and time-lapse imagery of hydrologic and glacier dynamics instabilities occurring throughout the upcoming surge of Turner Glacier. The team will combine in-situ observations with satellite-derived glacier velocity, elevation, terminus position, and subglacial plume data to map meltwater routing beneath the glacier during the initiation, propagation, and termination of the surge. These data will be paired with a state-of-the-art hydrologic numerical modeling to investigate the evolution of the controls on the hydrologic and dynamic glacier instabilities throughout the full surge. The unprecedented dataset, coupled with modern models, will yield improved, process-based understanding of a fundamental, 50-plus year-old, first-order question in glaciology: What controls the initiation, propagation, and termination of glacier surges? Given that the interplay between glacier hydrology, basal processes, and glacier flow remains one of the most fundamental questions in glaciology, the results of this project have broad societal impacts. Any insights into rapid instabilities in glacier flow triggered by climate will considerably advance our predictive capabilities of glacier change, and our ability to understand the impacts of ice mass loss on the Earth system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.078,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,671486.00,671486,4900,ANS-Arctic Natural Sciences,1954021,,Timothy C Bartholomaus,"875 Perimeter Drive, MS 3022",Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443022,tbartholomaus@uidaho.edu,Timothy,Bartholomaus,mstiegli@nsf.gov,Marc Stieglitz,7032924354,['0100XXXXDB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],08/12/2020,08/15/2020,07/31/2025,"Collaborative Research: Initiation, Propagation, and Termination: Understanding coupled hydrologic and glacier dynamic instabilities from the surge of Turner Glacier",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,C,"['Journal of Glaciology~2024~~Terleth, Yoram and Bartholomaus, Timothy C and Liu, Jukes and Beaud, Flavien and Mikesell, Thomas Dylan and Enderlin, Ellyn Mary~https://doi.org/10.1017/jog.2024.38~~~~~Transient subglacial water routing efficiency modulates ice velocities prior to surge termination on Sít’ Kusá, Alaska~N~~10526537~10526537~OSTI~2024-07-31 15:40:57.950~', 'Journal of Glaciology~2024~~Liu, Jukes and Enderlin, Ellyn M and Bartholomaus, Timothy C and Terleth, Yoram and Mikesell, Thomas Dylan and Beaud, Flavien~https://doi.org/10.1017/jog.2023.99~~~~~Propagating speedups during quiescence escalate to the 2020–2021 surge of Sít’ Kusá, southeast Alaska~N~~10526536~10526536~OSTI~2024-07-31 15:42:20.606~']",
"Non-Technical Abstract<br/>Many animal species have tails, which are remarkably diverse in shape and function. They can be short, long, thick, thin, feathered, hairy, bald, spiked, or even absent. Tails can serve many functions, including propulsion, communication, flagging or rattling, balancing, and grasping. However, although tails are important to animal function and evolution, compared to limbs, tails are vastly understudied. Relatively little is known about their development, morphological diversity, or mechanical function. This award supports a cross-disciplinary symposium that will bring together scientists and engineers who study a wide variety of tail and tail-related topics in animals and robots. It will facilitate and enhance exchange of knowledge and expertise. The outcomes of this symposium will be a collaborative workshop that will identify critical unanswered questions concerning the biology of tails and a roadmap for addressing these challenges through future research. The symposium highlights early-career researchers and members of groups under-represented in the sciences. In partnership with Howard University and the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology Broadening Participation Committee, participants in the symposium will host an outreach event to provide a networking experience for students from Howard University and potentially other Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the Washington, D.C. area.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Although diverse and common among animals, tails are vastly understudied structures, even though the importance of a functional post-anal appendage is recognized in many robotic designs. Understanding how tails develop and function contributes insight to potential evolutionary significance of the appendage. This symposium brings together investigators from multiple disciplines with research interests in this area who have worked relatively independently, from distinct perspectives. They will share findings on the diversity of development, form, and functions of tails - in animals and robots – and seek general principles that have driven the success of this appendage. The symposium will facilitate cross-disciplinary research discussions among fields including developmental biology, engineering, physics, and behavioral biology. In addition, an organized luncheon will further facilitate the active exchange of ideas, concepts, and approaches among diverse researchers who employ different model systems.  The symposium emphasizes early-career researchers and groups under-represented in STEM, and provides opportunities for mentoring, sharing of ideas and concepts, and development of new collaborations. The outcomes of the symposium will be a forward-looking review article that will delineate the current state of tail research and identify the unanswered questions with potential to be addressed by interdisciplinary collaborations.

In line with organizers? priorities, we emphasized inviting speakers who are early-career researchers and members of under-represented groups in the sciences.  This project focused on a 1-day symposium at the 2021 annual meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB), which was made virtual due to COVID-19. Associated with the symposium, we held two video conference virtual workshops in which participants in the symposium and complimentary sessions met to brainstorm ideas around open questions in tail research and propose goals for how these questions could be addressed. We leveraged the virtual format of the conference to focus on broadening participation at the high school level by supporting registration for students from Moscow, Idaho and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Under the guidance of their teachers, students participated in activities designed to determine the impact attendance at the SICB meeting had on their views of science and the likelihood they would pursue a career in a STEM field (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math).  The virtual format for the meeting and workshop proved to be highly successful with over 2,500 people registered for the meeting. The symposium and workshop resulted in 18 publications and achieved the goal of introducing scientists from across a broad range of backgrounds and career stages. Our broadening participation efforts opened the door for over 100 high school students to experience what fundamental biological research is like. It provided opportunities for them to ask questions of graduate students just getting started and seasoned faculty who have been attending conferences for decades. A subgroup of these students worked with their teachers and SICB communications staff to create blogs and vlogs about their experience attending the SICB meeting. This training included two writing workshops provided by the Managing Editor of a high impact science journal, Integrative and Comparative Biology. The feedback from the students was overwhelmingly positive and many reported gaining new interest in Biology, and an ongoing study will quantify the impact this project had on students? view of STEM fields.

Preliminary data has identified 1) a series of ligand dissection points that may govern the efficacy of oxidative dissolution; 2) that substitution patterns on ligands affect coordination of metal salts, giving clues to which ligand modifications may be most selective for dissolution / coordination; 3) recovery of metals is viable by electrochemical means and may be possible by chemical reduction to regain ligands and purify metals toward a circular, sustainable process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.049,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,408331.00,408331,4900,OFFICE OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY AC,2350243,,Kristopher V Waynant,,,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,kwaynant@uidaho.edu,Kristopher,Waynant,tli@nsf.gov,Tingyu Li,7032924949,['01002425DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],08/02/2024,08/15/2024,07/31/2027,Collaborative Research: CAS-SC: Investigating the Mild Ligand-based Oxidative Dissolution of E-waste Metals and Their Reductive Recovery,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['James Moberly'],V,,
"The Sierra Nevada of eastern California is a rugged mountain range home to deeply incised canyons and the highest peak in the conterminous United States. These features and a variety of studies have led many researchers to conclude that the high elevations are relatively recent (young tectonic uplift model). Other datasets, however, indicate a long-standing Sierra Nevada that has retained high elevations for the past 70 million years or more (old tectonic uplift model). Most studies favoring the young uplift model are from the southern part of the Sierra, whereas those favoring the old uplift model stem from studies of ancient gold-bearing river gravels and volcanic rocks only present in the north. This project will use low-temperature thermochronology (which can reveal the timing of exhumation), together with study of these ancient river deposits preserved on the western range flank, to address discrepancies between uplift models. Importantly, this work will create a range-wide thermochronologic dataset that will test whether conflicting interpretations are due to fundamental north to south changes in the geology of the mountain range or if the range shares a unified uplift history. Undergraduate and graduate students from three universities will be supported by this project and will receive mentoring from both their peers and principal investigators from all involved institutions. Three cohorts of high-school students will also be engaged in this research through a TRIO-INSPIRE STEM-Access summer internship program. <br/><br/>This project aims to constrain the exhumation history of the northern Sierra Nevada and its Cenozoic sediment sources to test hypotheses for possible along-strike variability in the history and causes of topographic uplift. Most thermochronologic and tectonic geomorphology studies are focused in the southern Sierra and support a model of recent (post-Miocene) tectonic uplift. In contrast, paleoaltimetric and detrital zircon (DZ) studies of Cenozoic strata preserved in the northern Sierra Nevada suggest development and maintenance of high topography since the Late Cretaceous. These spatially separated and often contrasting data have hindered agreement on an uplift theory for either part of the range. This study will use 1) basement (U-Th)/He data along two range-perpendicular transects in the northern Sierra, with a focus on sampling both modern valley and paleovalley bottoms, the latter immediately below the Eocene fluvial gravels, and 2) laser-ablation (U-Th)/(He-Pb) double dates coupled with Hf isotope data on targeted DZ sub-populations in the basal Eocene gravels to constrain incision timing and discriminate local vs. extra-regional sediment sources, which is not possible with the DZ U-Pb data alone. The integrated basement-detrital datasets will determine whether (U-Th)/He patterns are similar or different across the range, implying shared or separate uplift histories, and the Eocene position of the northern drainage divide, which informs the large-scale geometry of topography and fluvial drainages from the Sierra eastward to an elevated plateau. The researchers will test competing hypotheses for the uniformity, timing, and causes of Sierra Nevada uplift.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,304910.00,304910,4900,Tectonics,2333104,,Elizabeth J Cassel,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,ecassel@uidaho.edu,Elizabeth,Cassel,kblisniu@nsf.gov,Kimberly Blisniuk,7032924522,['01002425DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],08/15/2024,08/15/2024,07/31/2027,Collaborative Research: Development of topography in the northern Sierra Nevada: Reconciling differences in uplift history and causes through multi-source thermochronologic data,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,J,,
"The process of animal domestication often causes profound changes in fear-related behaviors, with domesticated populations becoming substantially less fearful than their wild ancestors.  The evolution of reduced fearfulness occurs in numerous domesticated vertebrates, including birds, mammals, and fish, but very little is known about the genetic changes that drive this process. Are the genetic changes that occur during domestication always the same, or are there many different genetic paths leading to the same behavioral outcome? To address this question, researchers must first identify the genes that regulate fear related behaviors in vertebrates. The proposed research uses genetic techniques to identify the genes that are responsible for differences in fear-related behaviors among wild and domesticated populations of zebrafish.  In addition to being an important biomedical model, the zebrafish is also emerging as a powerful model in behavior genetics.  The results of this research will be important in many contexts, including the study of molecular mechanisms of behavioral evolution, the genetic basis of complex behaviors, and the effective conservation of captively reared species.  <br/>Broader impacts: The issue of captive rearing is particularly relevant to the Native American tribes of Idaho and the Northwest because of the Tribe's close economic and cultural ties to salmon fisheries.

"This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the development of an integrated sensor network to measure atmospheric, hydrologic, geospheric and biological processes  along climatic, forest productivity and land use gradients.  The smart wireless sensor network is located in the wildlands of Idaho at The Taylor Wilderness Research Station (TWRS) in the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness (FCRW).   The sensor network thus enables researchers to conduct novel and innovative climate change research in remote mountainous regions where data to support climate and ecological models are lacking. Developing sensor networks that function in such challenging environments is essential since mountains make up ~20% of the earth surface. Furthermore, mountainous regions include wilderness and other relatively pristine natural sites with limited human impact, which are indispensable benchmarks for comparison with human dominated sites.  Data from the sensor network is used in climate and ecology research, to help train graduate students, and made available through the WWW for use by researchers beyond the University of Idaho.

The instrument consists of a 3-dimensional wireless sensor network that monitors climate conditions in remote locations and in rugged, complex terrain from within the rooting zone to the tops of trees.  Measured variables include air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, wind speed and direction, rainfall, barometric pressure, soil water content, soil temperature, short- and long-wave radiation, snow depth, tree trunk circumference, and leaf wetness.  Data are transmitted wirelessly to a base station through a self-healing mesh network that enables alternate communication pathways to be activated in the event that connections cannot be made to an individual transmission station.  Transmitted data are subsequently transmitted via a satellite internet connection to the collaborate.org web portal where registered users can access the data.  The resulting data allow scientists to better predict vegetation changes, impacts of changing temperature and precipitation patterns and the consequences of human use on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, all of which are essential for understanding the financial and ecological impacts of a changing climate.  The development of this instrument has also dramatically expanded direct measurements into one of the most remote locations in the coterminous U.S., transcending limitations of current technology.

"Mid-ocean ridges, the boundaries between separating tectonic plates, are some of the most volcanically active features on Earth. Along many ridges, storage of molten magma in shallow chambers results in heating of seawater stored in the porous crust. Thermally buoyant, this seawater rises through the crust, is chemically altered by water-rock interactions, and finally exits the seafloor at hydrothermal vents. It is now recognized that this type of deep-sea hydrothermal circulation plays a key role in controlling long-term ocean chemistry, the thermal and chemical structure of the oceanic crust, and the evolution of unique and diverse chemosynthetic ecosystems found nowhere else on the planet. However, quantifying the biological and chemical impact of hydrothermal circulation requires knowledge of the volume, heat, and chemical fluxes exiting the seafloor, which are notoriously difficult to quantify. One large source of uncertainty in flux estimates lies in the widespread distribution of lower-temperature (</=100°C) diffuse hydrothermal fluids, which are commonly transparent and escape through fractures, porous rock, and sediment. It is estimated that diffuse fluids contribute more to the heat and volume fluxes of hydrothermal systems than higher temperature (>300°C), ""black smoker"" style vents. Existing methods to quantify the flux of diffuse hydrothermal venting are limited by small measurement areas, measurements of a single quantity (e.g., only temperature or only velocity), or are invasive and alter the flow as they measure it. This project will develop new technologies for improved measurement of diffuse venting. Researchers will collaborate with University of Idaho, School of Engineering undergraduate students as part of their senior year Capstone Design Course to develop a prototype two-dimensional (2D) acoustic tomography system that can rapidly measure the temperature of anomalously warm, upwelling diffuse fluids across a ~1 m2 area. Development of these technologies will lead to future construction of a deep-sea measurement system targeting diffuse hydrothermal venting.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to develop a prototype two-dimensional (2D) acoustic tomography system capable of a time series of rapid (1 Hz) measurements of the temperature of anomalously warm, upwelling fluids at a spatial resolution of centimeters across a ~1 square meter area. The proposed system will consist of ~20-25 acoustic immersion transducers fixed at known spacing on a square, rigid frame. A subset of the transducers (~4-6) will emit staggered acoustic chirp pulses and the system will measure the pulse travel time between the emitting and receiving transducers. Using travel-time acoustic tomography, these travel times will be converted to sound speed and finally temperature throughout the 2D domain.  Development will begin with a two-transducer, 1D system to test appropriate signal frequencies (e.g., kHz or MHz), chirp type (increasing or decreasing frequency), transducer shapes (e.g., spherical, planar, cylindrical), and effective measurement rates. Building upon these results, the final prototype will utilize the optimum transducer shape and pulse frequencies. After construction, the system will undergo submergence tests at the University of Idaho with controlled sources of warm, buoyantly rising fluids. To calculate fluid temperatures, we will evaluate several travel-time inversion methods including the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART), multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (MART), and simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT).  Final results will be compared to thermocouple measurements distributed throughout the 2D measurement domain.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,51826.00,51826,4900,OCEAN TECH & INTERDISC COORDIN,1744255,,Eric L Mittelstaedt,875 Perimeter Dr. MS3022,Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443022,emittelstaedt@uidaho.edu,Eric,Mittelstaedt,kbinkley@nsf.gov,Kandace Binkley,7032927577,['01001718DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],06/06/2017,08/15/2017,12/31/2019,EAGER: Development of a Prototype 2D Acoustic Tomography System for Rapid Temperature Measurements in Diffuse Hydrothermal Effluent,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Ralph S Budwig', 'Michael J Anderson']",L,," Mid-ocean ridges, the boundaries between separating tectonic plates, are some of the most volcanically active features on Earth and the location of unique geothermal fluid circulation systems called hydrothermal vents. Along many ridges, storage of molten magma in subsurface chambers results in heating of seawater stored in the surrounding, porous rocks. Just as hot air rises, this hot seawater rises toward the seafloor where it exits and forms hydrothermal vents. It is now recognized that this type of deep-sea hydrothermal circulation plays a key role in controlling long-term ocean chemistry, the thermal and chemical structure of the oceanic crust, and the evolution of unique and diverse chemosynthetic ecosystems found nowhere else on the planet. Yet, our understanding of a hydrothermal vent?s impact on our planet requires knowledge of the rate fluid enters the oceans, a value that is notoriously difficult to quantify. This is especially true for the lower temperature (&le;100?C), diffuse venting of nearly clear fluids that commonly surround the more visually more spectacular, hot (&gt;300?C) jets of dark fluids leaving ?black smoker? vents. Due to its widespread nature and low visibility, estimates of the flux of diffuse fluids into the ocean can differ by tens to thousands of times, depending upon the method of measurement used.  Intellectual Merit: This project aimed to develop new methods and technology for rapid measurement of temperatures in thermally buoyant, rising diffuse hydrothermal fluids. The primary outcome of this project is the adaptation of existing technologies and development of new technologies for construction of a prototype acoustic tomography system capable of measuring water temperature across a ~1 m wide area. Testing and development of these technologies is the first step toward an improved method for measuring diffuse venting fluxes. We successfully developed a prototype system capable of a time series of rapid (1 Hz) measurements of the temperature of fluids across ~1 meter. The system consists of three acoustic immersion transducers fixed at known spacing on a square, rigid, aluminum frame. A custom-built driving circuit sends a regularly timed electronic signal to a sending transducer that then emits acoustic pulses to the listening transducers. The time it takes this sound pulse to travel between the emitting and receiving transducers is measured and allows calculation of the sound speed in the water (a strong function of temperature). The sound speed is then converted to water temperature in the space between the sending and receiving transducers.   Although limited in scope, the prototype developed during this project successfully achieved several key results that will inform construction a fully-functional, deep-sea thermal measurement system: 1) acoustic determination of water temperatures at &lt;0.5% error, 2) reasonable spatial resolution of thermal differences in the water column (~centimeters), 3) an angular width of the send signal allowing few sending and many receiving transducers, 4) a mechanically robust frame that could be used to accurately place transducers in a given configuration, and 5) a custom-built driving circuit capable of sending and receiving ~10?s to 100?s of individual acoustic signals in &lt;1s.  Broader Impacts: In addition to the goal of developing new measurement technology, this project emphasized undergraduate and graduate participation as part of its Broader Impacts. During the 2018/2019 school year, a team of three University of Idaho undergraduate students in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering worked on researching and testing the appropriate hardware and acoustic set-up for the proposed tomography system. Design and development of the system was the focus of their Capstone course (final, hands-on course of their degrees) and allowed these students to take on a real world problem, including budgeting, communicating with a ?customer?, and hardware development. This training will prove invaluable in the future careers of these students.  Additionally, in the summer of 2019, the PI worked with a graduate student in Electrical Engineering to develop the custom driving circuit for the system and to test the beam width and signal detection of multiple transducers from a single sending transducer. The student was provided an opportunity to supplement his PhD work with a project in a specialty (circuits) supplementary to his doctoral research.

"Scientific efforts that focus on innovations at the nexus of food, energy, and water systems (INFEWS) necessarily require that scientists work closely with non-scientists to produce beneficial, appropriate, and useable sustainability outcomes. Scientific approaches that involve communities, industry, tribal organizations, non-governmental organizations, government agencies, and other stakeholders have been called ""community-engaged research"" or ""stakeholder engagement."" The EngageINFEWS research coordination network (RCN) brings together a diverse group of scientists and non-scientists to develop and document a cohesive set of best practices for community engaged research at the intersection of food, energy, and water systems (FEWS) science. EngageINFEWS aims to advance knowledge of community-engaged research and to help food, energy, and water systems (FEWS) science serve the needs of various stakeholders interested in FEWS.  Results of this RCN will serve to ensure that human communities are equipped with the best possible tools to respond to both chronic and acute social and environmental changes impacting food, energy, and water systems (FEWS). <br/><br/>Community- and stakeholder-engaged research seeks to create a productive and collaborative space for scholarship that involves non-scientists in scientific work. The framework developed by the EngageINFEWS research collaborative network (RCN) considers how principles of collaborative governance may be useful in developing and understanding best practices for working both in and with communities to improve FEWS research. The overarching hypothesis of this RCN is that appropriate approaches to community and stakeholder engagement are determined by the context of specific FEWS projects and differ based on each context. EngageINFEWS is informed by two framing questions: 1) How are community and stakeholder engagement best integrated into interdisciplinary FEWS projects? 2) How can INFEWS teams conduct productive community and stakeholder engagement to support research and educational activities? The overarching goal of the EngageINFEWS RCN is to develop a set of current and best practices across FEWS efforts. This goal is being achieved using a framework co-created by EngageINFEWS network members that is iterative, interdisciplinary, reflexive, and evaluative.

"The incidence of extreme heat events has increased in frequency and intensity in the last century as global temperatures have risen, driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing. When extreme heat occurs at the same time as drought, the impacts are exacerbated. These ""hot drought"" events have complex consequences for communities across North America, including altered water resource availability and fire regimes, as well as the magnitude of the uptake of carbon dioxide by forests. This project will compile new and previously collected temperature reconstruction data from tree cores from across North America into a ""North American Temperature Atlas,"" which will allow for the analysis of relationship of heat and drought at a range of time and spatial scales.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to make new blue intensity measurements on previously collected tree cores from North America, compile existing blue intensity and maximum latewood density tree ring chronologies from North America, and combine the new and existing datasets together to create the “North American Temperature Atlas” (NATA), a gridded reconstruction of warm season surface air temperature. The NATA will be compared to a gridded North American drought atlas and a gridded North American seasonal precipitation atlas to determine the contribution of temperature to past droughts, evaluate the temperature-drought relationship, and place the modern occurrence of drought in the context of the last several centuries. The Broader Impacts are to create a web interface for public access to the NATA, support for graduate students at University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and University of Idaho, development of outreach to water and natural resource managers, creation of K-12 STEM activities for middle school students, tours of tree ring lab for K-12 students, mentoring high school and undergraduate students underrepresented in STEM on projects related to this work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,147279.00,147279,4900,P4CLIMATE,2402388,,Grant Harley,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,gharley@uidaho.edu,Grant,Harley,mcook@nsf.gov,Mea S.

"This project is about understanding the interactions between land-use policies, agricultural rural development and land use change in tropical landscapes, and how these changes affect the resilience of and relationships between human populations and the natural ecosystems present in these landscapes. Millions of hectares of tropical forests have been converted to agriculture leaving behind patches of remnant natural forest embedded in an agricultural matrix. Historically, this agricultural matrix was dominated by subsistence crops and pasture, but in some areas this land is rapidly being replaced with intensive plantation agriculture for soybean, banana, and pineapple production. In contrast with more traditional land uses, these crops require higher inputs of labor, money, agrochemicals, and infrastructure. The impacts of this new land conversion trend are not well understood, but preliminary studies suggest that intensive plantation agriculture may drive dramatic demographic and economic changes in local communities and have profound effects on ecological systems. Ultimately, these impacts will change the ability of these human and ecological communities to maintain resilience to future change. Thus, a better understanding is needed of the relationships among land-use policies, ecosystem structure and function, and the decisions and actions of local communities and land managers that ultimately determine where and how fast intensive plantation agriculture will spread. This project will evaluate these relationships in the model system of the San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor in Costa Rica. Specifically, this research will address a variety of research questions, such as: What national policies led to the establishment and spread of intensive non-traditional plantation crops? For three focal regions, what is the status of the social and ecological indicators of resilience? How will current and alternative policy scenarios affect future land use patterns, and how will these affect ecological resilience? How does future scenario modeling of projected land use changes influence the perceptions of community members and land managers about their future social and ecological resilience? This effort incorporates stakeholder input at every step of the research; implements two new ecological approaches, functional traits analysis and landscape genetics; and explicitly measures both social and ecological resilience in the same system and at multiple spatial and temporal scales.<br/><br/>Findings from this research will advance understanding of how human communities and ecosystems respond to agricultural intensification, and will therefore help scientists and managers better understand how to manage for resilience in the face of global change. At the local scale, findings will be shared through stakeholder workshops with community leaders and regional land managers; these workshops will provide participants with information to make informed land use decisions, and develop community capacity to adapt to change. At the global scale, findings from this research will be disseminated through presentations at the participating universities, at professional conferences, and through publication of peer-reviewed papers in scientific journals.  In addition, this project will contribute to the interdisciplinary research training of multiple undergraduates and five Ph.D. students, all from under-represented groups.

This has created complex landscapes that resemble a quilt, with patches of natural forest embedded in an agricultural matrix. In recent years, a new pattern has emerged in these landscapes: intensive, monoculture plantations of export crops like soybean, pineapple, and oil palm are rapidly replacing less intensive, more heterogeneous agriculture types like pasture with trees. The impacts of this new pattern of agricultural intensification are not well understood, but preliminary studies suggest that the arrival and spread of intensive plantation agriculture may drive dramatic demographic and economic change in local communities, have profound effects on the structure and function of natural forest fragments, and lead to a disconnect between social and ecological systems.     Our project aimed to find ways to mitigate these impacts by understanding the linkages among land-use policies, ecosystem structure and function, and the decision-making processes of local communities and land managers. This project was a joint effort between the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho and the Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center in Costa Rica. For our study area, we chose the San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor (SJLS) in Costa Rica, which is part of the larger Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. The history of land use in the SJLS region reflects a recent pattern in the tropics, where initial deforestation to establish cattle ranching and subsistence crops created a heterogeneous agricultural landscape, which is now being replaced by intensive, monoculture pineapple plantations. Understanding the links between social and ecological systems in the SJLS is a complex problem that called for an interdisciplinary approach, and one of the first successes of our project was building an integrated, interdisciplinary team of students and faculty from the two partner institutions, with expertise in tropical forest ecology, conservation genetics, rural sociology, political ecology, and remote sensing.     Our primary research goals were to: 1) describe the social and economic implications of pineapple expansion, (2) quantify pineapple cultivation?s spatial characteristics, and (3) assess the effects of pineapple expansion on surrounding forest ecosystems, on the agricultural matrix and on biodiversity conservation. To achieve these goals, we conducted extensive field work in the study area, including 35 interviews with landowners and community leaders, field surveys to measure properties of secondary forest patches, functional traits of mature forest patches, and to collect genetic data on bats and two understory plant species which rely on bats for pollination and seed dispersal. Using remotely sensed imagery, we produced the highest-resolution land cover map of Sarapiqui, Costa Rica, to date, and disseminated the map to local decision-makers who can use it in future land use planning and research for the region. This included the municipal government planning office, the Costa Rican National Park Service, the Costa Rican Ministry of Agriculture, five local ecolodges, and two research institutions including La Selva Biological Station. Analyses of the field and remotely sensed data revealed the specific impacts of pineapple expansion on important measures of social and ecological resilience, including household-level economic resilience, bat community composition, abundance, and diversity, and genetic connectivity for bats and bat-dispersed plants, and metrics of forest regeneration such as above ground biomass. Our combined analyses  ultimately provided empirical evidence that agricultural intensification is simplifying and homogenizing both ecological and economic systems in the SJLS region. Our findings advance understanding of the role of functional characteristics and functional connectivity in conservation, and we hope will help scientists and managers in similar landscapes worldwide better understand how to manage complex landscapes in the face of global change to achieve positive outcomes for humans and the environment.     Throughout the course of the project, we consistently communicated our findings to local stakeholders. We did this through presentations at three initial community-based workshops, by distributing environmental education materials to local ecotourism agencies and non-profits, by presenting at the SJLS committee management meetings, and by developing bat species inventory reports for landowners. In 2015, we organized final participatory stakeholder workshops where results were shared with 30 participants representing local land management agencies, ecotourism companies, community organizations, conservation organizations, and the agricultural sector. We also disseminated our findings to the scientific community through the publication of eight peer-reviewed scientific papers, five PhD dissertations, one book chapter, invited talks at multiple universities and community centers, and more than 20 presentations at professional meetings. Finally, our project provided training and professional development opportunities for five undergraduate students and five doctoral students from underrepresented groups. All of the doctoral students successfully wrote and defended their dissertations during the project and are now employed in diverse sectors, including academia, government, and non-profit work.

"The 2011 drought in Texas, Oklahoma, and eastern New Mexico was the most severe one-year drought in the region since meteorological record-keeping began in 1895 and potentially the worst single-year drought in over 1200 years. This drought continued through 2014 and killed a half billion trees in Texas between 2011 and 2014. Research on trees during this drought documented patterns of mortality, photosynthesis, and water use for individuals spread across several research sites. This project examines how these same landscapes and trees respond to alleviation of drought. Central Texas has gone from an extreme drought in August of 2011 to essentially no drought in July 2015, due to one of the wettest spring and early summer periods on record. This provides a unique ""natural experiment"" in which to test hypotheses about those plant traits associated with resistance to drought and recovery from drought. A primary hypothesis to be tested is that species that were able to maintain greater photosynthesis during the drought will recover more quickly (i.e. will maintain greater photosynthesis and will exhibit greater growth) than those species that were unable to maintain photosynthesis. Because more extreme and episodic climate patterns are predicted for the near future, this research will contribute to the understanding of how vegetation will respond to extreme variation in water availability. This information will be particularly useful to land managers to ensure the presence of vegetation and the maintenance of the ecosystem services that vegetation provides. The project also involves training of undergraduate students and postdoctoral associates in plant stress research.<br/>  <br/>The frequency and intensity of episodic droughts are predicted to increase in the future, and these patterns have already been observed over the last 15 years. However, little information exists about what physiological changes occur in naturally-growing trees that survive a severe drought. Central Texas experienced the worst single-year drought in its recorded history in 2011. That drought continued through 2014 and killed an estimated half billion trees. In 2015, Central Texas experienced late spring and early summer rainfall that exceeded long-term averages by 10 times. Climate predictions for the area for the next three months are for below average temperatures and above average rainfall. This unusual combination of climatic events provides a unique situation in which to study vegetation responses to rapid alleviation of drought. A major advantage this project exploits is the previous characterization by the investigators of physiological and hydraulic conductance responses of trees to the severe 2011-2014 drought.  These same individuals and sites will be measured for physiological parameters (gas exchange, hydraulic parameters), anatomy, and growth to allow the comparison of measurements taken during and after the drought. The measurements will be used to parameterize a process-based model to predict the carbon and water status of these trees under different moisture availability scenarios.  The project has significant broader impacts in land management and conservation of forests under extreme variation in water availability.  Undergraduate students will be involved directly in the research, along with postdoctoral associates.

This is of importantce befcause most vegetation and physiological models assume that significant rainfall events alleviate all previous drought and that plants that are more resistant to hydraulic dysfunction have greater growth and survival during drought. This research both points to our lack of understanding concerning drought tolerance but also suggests other mechanisms that may be important in drought tolerance (e.g., continued photosynthesis during drought).

"Non-Technical Abstract:<br/>Polymers, which are composed of repeating units called monomers, are everywhere. Polymers that contain large amounts of water, like contact lenses, are called hydrogels. One use of hydrogels involves placing these materials into the body to help overcome a biological deficiency (injury, disease, impairment, etc.). The body’s response to these “biomaterials” is dependent upon the material properties - incompatible materials are rejected by the body. Similarly, the physical characteristics should match those of the original tissue. There is a need for more control over the biomaterials given this broad range of applications. The goal of this project is to create a new class of hydrogels that provide improved control of the material properties. This will be done through the creation of new charged, but neutral, amino acid-based molecules that hold the hydrogel together (cross-linkers). These species will react with other charged monomers creating three-dimensional hydrogel networks. Important hydrogel properties that will be investigated include the binding of biological species, the delivery of biological signals, the material physical properties, and the breakdown of the biomaterial over time. The material properties will be linked to the composition of the amino acid-based molecules. The result will be a library of new hydrogels with controlled properties for broad use. A series of experiments will also be created for professional development workshops with local high school teachers to bring this science to the classroom.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>There is a need for novel bioadaptable materials to address clinical challenges associated with biomedical therapies and other biological applications that use polymer-based materials. To be defined as bioadaptable, the material must meet four criteria: resistance to nonspecific protein adsorption, the ability to deliver specific biological signaling molecules (proteins, peptides, etc.), tunable mechanical properties, and tunable degradation behavior. Polyampholyte biomaterials show promise for being defined as bioadaptable because of their demonstrated nonfouling behavior, ability to deliver bioactive proteins, multiple approaches for controlling their mechanical properties, and tunable degradation behavior. However, a significant limitation to the advancement of these polymers is the lack of zwitterionic cross-linker molecules and a subsequent understanding of the cross-linker structure and physical property relationships that will guide their end use. The overall goal is to design and synthesize a library of peptide-based zwitterionic cross-linkers which will be incorporated into polyampholyte hydrogels to develop structure-property relationships between the cross-linker species and the resulting polymer hydrogels. This will lead to a fundamental understanding of design criteria for the cross-linker which in turn will facilitate development of bioadaptable biomaterial hydrogels. It is hypothesized that molecular-level control over the length, chemistry, charge spacing, charge density, and pendant side chain presentation will lead to the demonstration of bioadaptable polyampholyte hydrogels. This hypothesis will be tested by synthesizing peptide-based cross-linkers with controlled structure and incorporating these cross-linkers into polyampholyte hydrogels. Hydrogel performance metrics will be evaluated, resulting in a fundamental correlation of the structure-property relationships of polyampholyte hydrogel performance metrics to structural design features in the library of peptide-based zwitterionic cross-linkers. The award will provide course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) for students at the University of Idaho. The team will also provide teacher workshops to broaden knowledge in the topic of hydrogels.<br/><br/>This project is jointed funded by the Biomaterials (BMAT) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,"47.049, 47.083",QWYKRJH5NNJ3,645273.00,645273,4900,BIOMATERIALS PROGRAM,2306118,,Kristopher V Waynant,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,kwaynant@uidaho.edu,Kristopher,Waynant,nirosenz@nsf.gov,Nitsa Rosenzweig,7032927256,['01002324DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],05/15/2023,08/15/2023,07/31/2026,Synthesis of Peptide-based Zwitterionic Cross-linkers and Evaluation in Bioadaptable Hydrogels,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Matthew T Bernards'],V,,
"Riparian vegetation patches rapidly colonize exposed bars in gravel-bed rivers, impacting the nearby flow hydraulics and subsequent erosional-depositional processes during flood events. This vegetation-forced erosion and deposition on gravel bars is important as it alters the size and composition of the bed sediments that affects aquatic and riparian habitat quality, drives changes in subsurface hydraulics and associated water quality, as well as impacts flow conveyance and community flood risk. This project seeks to understand how the hydraulics and sediment transport capacity change through vegetation patches to explain the spatial patterns of observed bed sediments and resultant shape of gravel bars. The magnitude of changes is expected to depend on the vegetation density within a patch. Results can help guide water agencies in deciding what vegetation planting densities are necessary during river restoration activities to achieve the desired evolutionary outcomes. Additionally, results are expected to help flood managers predict gravel bar dimensions from existing vegetation densities and determine if vegetation thinning or removal is necessary for public safety.<br/><br/>Predicting vegetated bar evolution is difficult because the local hydraulics and sediment mobility (initiation of sediment motion) are spatially variable through a vegetation patch. Currently, no single parameter is available to predict coarse-sediment mobility in both open and vegetated channels. Here, a combination of fieldwork and large-scale flume experiments with vegetation simulants will be used to develop a mechanistic driver of coarse-sediment mobility that is applicable in both vegetated and unvegetated conditions. In the planned experiments, vegetation density will be varied to identify a density threshold that initiates grain-size changes, spatial sorting, and bar evolution in gravel-bed rivers. Further, a predictive relation between vegetation density and equilibrium bar dimensions will be developed.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics (GLD) and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,"47.050, 47.083",QWYKRJH5NNJ3,443525.00,443525,4900,Geomorphology & Land-use Dynam,2245496,,Andrew Tranmer,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,andyt@uidaho.edu,Andrew,Tranmer,ramartin@nsf.gov,Raleigh Martin,7032927199,['01002324DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/28/2023,08/15/2023,07/31/2026,Characterizing the physical drivers of vegetation-forced bar evolution in gravel-bed streams,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,,
"The advancement of computing, communication, and storage technologies is pivotal for the progress of science and national welfare. This project aims to enhance the analysis and design optimization of on-chip optical interconnect technologies, crucial for achieving ultra-high bandwidth and speeds in modern computing infrastructures. Through the development of an innovative computational electromagnetics (CEM) framework, this project addresses the limitations of current models in accurately simulating on-chip optical channels. These channels are vital for data transfer in systems ranging from server farms to smartphones, enabling cutting-edge applications such as Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT). The project's outcomes promise to significantly advance technological fields, improving communication, education, healthcare, agriculture, energy efficiency, mobility, and national security, thereby contributing to the United States' competitiveness in key economic sectors. Furthermore, the project underscores a commitment to educational enhancement and diversity by integrating the project’s key results into graduate curricula and fostering the inclusive recruitment of students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award focuses on creating a novel computational electromagnetics (CEM) framework that incorporates physics-informed artificial intelligence (AI) to efficiently perform signal/power integrity simulations of realistic three-dimensional, nano-scale silicon-on-insulator (SOI) channels exhibiting random surface roughness. Addressing the challenges of computational expense and limited model fidelity in existing approaches, the project proposes three specific aims: 1) Formulating an energy-conserved Hamiltonian electromagnetic macro-model based on finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods; 2) Developing physics-informed AI models as Hamiltonian deep neural networks to expedite the generation and utilization of the macro-model in FDTD; 3) Integrating these AI models into the simulation process to efficiently compute stochastic electromagnetic fields and assess the impact of random surface roughness on the signal/power integrity of realistic SOI channels. This project is poised to advance and transform CEM and signal/power integrity analysis by enabling accurate, fast, and stable modeling of optical interconnects, facilitating the design of exa-scale bandwidth data-transfer networks. The project’s AI-CEM framework may be extended beyond optical SOI channels to model a broad range of complex optoelectronic devices, thus fostering design innovations in interdisciplinary areas like communication, sensing, and quantum computing. The AI-enabled Optical Interconnect Designer Tool (AIeOIDT) will be developed and available as open-source software to encourage collaboration and innovation.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Foundations of Emerging Technology (FET) Cluster of the CCF Division in the CISE Directorate, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,"47.070, 47.083",QWYKRJH5NNJ3,300000.00,300000,4900,FET-Fndtns of Emerging Tech,2421919,,Ata Zadehgol,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,azadehgol@uidaho.edu,Ata,Zadehgol,sabasu@nsf.gov,Sankar Basu,7032927843,['01002425DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],05/15/2024,08/15/2024,07/31/2026,FET: EAGER: Physics-Informed AI-Models for Efficient Computation of Stochastic Electromagnetic Fields in Realistic 3D Nano-Scale Optical Interconnects,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,,

"This Pathways Project connects rural, underserved youth and families in Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho to STEM concepts important in sustainable building design. The project is a collaboration of the Palouse Discovery Science Center (Pullman, WA), Washington State University and University of Idaho, working in partnership with rural community organizations and businesses. The deliverables include: 1) interactive exhibit prototype activities, 2) a team cooperative learning problem-solving challenge, and (3) take-home materials to encourage participants to use what they have learned to investigate ways to make their homes more energy-efficient and sustainable.<br/><br/>The project introduces youth and families to the traditionally difficult physics concept of thermal energy, particularly as it relates to sustainable building design. Participants explore how building materials and their properties can be used to control all three types of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation. The interactive exhibit prototypes are coupled with an Energy Efficient Engineering Challenge in which participants, working in cooperative learning teams, use information learned from the exhibit prototype activities to retrofit a model house, improving its energy efficiency. The project components are piloted at the Palouse Discovery Science Center, and then travel to three underserved rural/tribal communities in Northern Idaho and Eastern Washington. Front-end and formative evaluation studies will demonstrate whether this model advances participant understanding of and interest in STEM topics and careers. <br/><br/>The project will yield information about ways that other ISE practitioners can effectively incorporate cooperative learning strategies in informal settings to improve the transferability of knowledge gained from exhibits to real-world problem-solving challenges, especially for rural and underserved audiences. This project will also provide the ISE field with: 1) a model for increasing the capacity of small, rural science centers to form collaborative regional networks that draw on previously unused resources in their communities and provide more effective outreach to the underrepresented populations they serve, and 2) a model for coupling cooperative learning with outreach exhibits, providing richer experiences of active engagement.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.076,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,42898.00,42898,4900,AISL,1223449,,Christine A Berven,950 NE Nelson Ct.,Pullman,US,WA05,Palouse Discovery Science Center,WA,991635608,berven@uidaho.edu,Christine,Berven,rlrussel@nsf.gov,Robert Russell,7032922995,['04001213DB NSF Education & Human Resource'],08/07/2012,08/15/2012,07/31/2015,"Collaborative Research, Pathways Project: Project SOS - Making Connections using the Science Of Sustainability",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Anne L Kern'],A,,"   How can understanding science help us stay warm when itÆs cold outside? Do the same principles apply when we want to keep our homes warm in winter? Can science help us save energy and make our homes more sustainable? Understanding the physics of heat energy allows us to answer these questions, to see connections in a variety of situations around us, and to realize how science can be used to help solve real-world problems.     Project SOS: Making Connections Using the Science Of Sustainability, funded by the National Science Foundation, was developed by an interdisciplinary team from the Palouse Discovery Science Center (PDSC), University of Idaho, Washington State University, and the Palouse-Clearwater Environmental Institute. In collaboration with representatives from local power companies and the communities served by the project, the team effectively developed and tested a model for a unique science outreach program aimed at rural youth (ages 11-15) and their families. The program, which focuses on the science behind how heat energy moves and how to slow down that movement in order to save energy in our homes, includes (1) hands-on activities, (2) interactive exhibits, (3) team cooperative learning problem-solving challenges, and (4) take-home materials for participants to use as ""heat science detectives"" to find areas of heat loss and investigate ways to make their homes more energy-efficient and sustainable. Program components were tested and revised in three rural communities in northern Idaho and eastern Washington. The final version of the program consisted of the following:    In a one-day session, participants:   explored heat energy through hands-on activities, computer-based animations, and a team challenge;   experienced hands-on exhibit prototypes to discover how building materials and their properties can be used to control all three types of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation;   worked as cooperative learning teams to apply what they had learned from the exhibit activities to retrofit a tabletop model house and improve its energy efficiency (the Model House Challenge); and   received Home Energy Audit Training (HEAT) kits with take-home materials to apply what they learned to investigate heat transfer in their own homes.       A week later, youth and their families met at the PDSC to discuss their findings with the Project SOS Team and power company representatives, receive free weatherization materials to fix problem areas in their homes, and learn about related career opportunities in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math).    Intellectual Merit Project SOS explored how best to introduce participants to the traditionally difficult physics concepts of heat energy and heat transfer, particularly as they relate to sustainable building design. The project addressed many common misconceptions about heat energy by developing hands-on activities and demonstrations that made it possible for participants to ""visualize"" how heat energy moves in several different everyday situations and thus better understand how the same physics principles apply in all cases. The project also included a cooperative learning component to promote the transfer of knowledge gained from using the exhibit prototypes to the problem-solving required to successfully complete the Model House Challenge. Youths worked in teams of 6, with 2 members becoming experts in each type of heat transfer. Each pair of experts then shared what they learned with the rest of their team before solving their Model House Challenge. This use of cooperative learning simulated how scientists work together, gave youth an opportunity to practice explaining these concepts to their peers, and encouraged practice explaining these concepts to them to use what they had learned to solve the challenge. Finally, youth were shown how to use simple tools to pinpoint areas of heat loss in their own homes and find ways to fix them. This innov..."

"The goal of the project is to develop an integrative approach to understanding incipient and youthful rift zones developing in thick continental lithosphere by targeting a portion of the East African Rift system in northern Tanzania and southern Kenya. The development of these rifts is a fundamental plate tectonic process yet the driving forces behind rift initiation and early evolution are tenuously understood, particularly the feedbacks and trade-offs between strain accommodation by magmatic and tectonic processes (dike intrusion vs. faulting). Furthermore, the integrative roles of hydrothermal fluids and preexisting structure in weakening the lithosphere and focusing deformation and magmatic activity are virtually unexplored in developing rift systems. This project seeks to explain the relative roles of magma systems below incipient rifts, the development of large border faults and systems of distributed normal faults across rift valleys, and the geochemical influences of hydrothermal fluids in weakening thick continental lithosphere and promoting the development and evolution of focused rift zones. This analysis will utilize: (1) field-based mapping of fault system geometries and dynamics to characterize spatial patterns of strain in association with magmatic systems; (2) 3D visualization of magmatic and fault systems in the lithosphere, and crustal and upper mantle structure along the length of the rift zone segments, using geophysical imaging (a broadband seismic array); (3) sampling of gas emissions from hydrothermal springs along border fault systems to determine chemical signatures of fluids that may contribute to weakening within the lithosphere; and (4) sampling of volcanic products exposed by fault systems for geochronologic analysis, providing temporal constraints on faulting events in relation to magmatic episodes and allowing a quantification of time-averaged strain rates. This study will result in the development of an integrated model of magmatic and fault system interactions during the early stages of rifting that can serve as a benchmark for evaluating continental rift evolution globally.<br/><br/>Continental rift zones are enigmatic in that they develop in thick, strong continental lithosphere for reasons that are poorly understood. Their development is a linchpin of the of plate tectonic process, however, facilitating continents breaking apart, forming ocean basins by the process of mid-ocean ridge spreading. Rift zones worldwide are commonly associated with large magnitude earthquakes as well as volcanic activity, either focused at discrete volcanoes or erupting from tens of kilometer long fissures. They thus present geologic hazards that threaten humans living in rift zone environments worldwide, including the U.S.A. Past work on rift zones in advanced stages of development (prior to continental breakup) has shown that the progressive stretching and thinning of the continental lithosphere by rifting allows the mantle to well up beneath the rift and melt. In young and developing rift systems, however, magma appears to be important for rifting despite very little mantle upwelling at that stage. This suggests that, despite the presence of thick continental lithosphere, magma is able to form and ascend into the crust, enabling extension and helping to drive the faulting. The lithosphere is clearly weakened in some manner to allow magmatic activity to be so focused. This research team hypothesizes that lithosphere weakening is assisted by focused, deep mantle fluids associated with developing magmatic systems and that these fluids chemically alter and weaken the lithosphere, allowing magma to intrude and drive rift development. This work in the East African Rift will allow researchers to determine the relative roles of these fluids and intruding magma in weakening the lithosphere and allowing faults to develop. By combining fieldwork, geophysics, geochemistry, and geochronology, a model for rift development and evolution will be formulated that is integrated across disciplines and will capture multiple facets of the rifting processes. The results of the work will be applicable to rift zone development globally and can thus be integrated into existing plate tectonic models to provide a rationale for why continental breakup is possible.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,269591.00,269591,4900,Tectonics,1113677,,Simon A Kattenhorn,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,skattenhorn@alaska.edu,Simon,Kattenhorn,,David Fountain,,"['01001112DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001314DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",08/15/2011,08/15/2011,07/31/2015,"Collaborative Research: Testing the Role of Magma and Related Fluids in Early-Stage Rifting, East Africa",Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,A,"['Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems~2015~16~Muirhead, J.D., Kattenhorn, S.A., Le Corvec, N.~10.1002/2015GC005918~~~~~Varying styles of magmatic strain accommodation across the East African Rift~~~~~~~']"," Our comparison of two portions of the East African Rift (the ~7 million-year-old Magadi basin in Kenya and the less evolved ~3 million-year-old Natron basin in Tanzania) revealed a distinct shift in strain accommodation and focusing of fluids during the early stages of rift evolution. At Natron, the border fault along the edge of the rift shows evidence of recent surface-breaking earthquake events and provides a distinct seismic hazard to the region given the ~100 km fault length. Most of the fault activity in the Magadi basin appears to have migrated away from the border fault system toward the rift center, concurrent with a shift in the focus of magmatic and hydrothermal activity, and reflects a fundamental evolutionary pattern in rift progression. Fault scarps are noticeably sharper and segments more evolved at the rift center in the more evolved Magadi basin in comparison to intra-rift faults in the relatively younger Tanzanian rift, reflecting shorter time intervals between earthquakes and potentially a higher seismic hazard. An analysis of displacement distributions along &gt;3000 rift faults from field-based and satellite mapping, combined with 40Ar-39Ar lava chronology on faulted volcanics in the Natron and Magadi basins, indicate that strain migrates from border faults to intra-rift faults in the center of basins about 6 Myr after rift initiation. The migration of strain from the border fault of the Magadi rift (the Nguruman fault) toward the rift center was accommodated along a major transverse fault across the rift. The orientation of this ~50-km-long fault (the Kordja fault) was influenced by inherited crustal weaknesses in the underlying cratonic rocks as well as stress perturbations related to adjacent rift segments interacting with each other. Transverse faults may represent a fundamental mechanism for the transfer of strain away from the border fault system toward the rift center. The Kordjya fault may create a seismic hazard to the local population. Hydrothermal activity is focused along the most recently active faults and results in a significant carbon dioxide (CO2) flux into the atmosphere. Geochemical analysis confirms an upper mantle signature for the CO2, implying that deep carbon is transported from lower crustal magmas into fault systems within the upper crust. The potential flux of this CO2 along the entire East African Rift is calculated to be significant, similar to that from the worldÆs mid-ocean ridge system, suggesting that continental rifting may constitute one source for atmospheric CO2. Fault strain concentrates into a ~20 km-wide zone near the rift center. This localization indicates a focusing of magma below the rift zone, but could also potentially indicates a necking instability unrelated to dike intrusion. The locations and orientations of eruptive dikes in rift basins vary over the course of rift evolution, and are affected by proximity to volcanoes. During early-stage rifting (&lt;10 Ma), upper crustal dikes play a limited role in accommodating extension and are confined to areas in and around transfer zones between primary rift segments. Border fault systems are likely ultimately abandoned in favor of focused strain at the rift center, moving into the transition to mid-ocean ridge spreading (e.g., the transitional Ethiopian rift).   This project provided training and field research opportunities for two graduate students at the University of Idaho. Project success was assisted by the development of scientific collaborations with researchers at the University of Nairobi, Kenya, and the University of Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. Information about the geologic findings and seismic hazards was shared locally through direct interactions with Maasai populations. Scientific findings were shared with the global research community through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at scientific conferences.

"9507612  Weil  Among three related alleles of the maize waxy (Wx) gene. each caused by a 2 kilobase Ds insertion into precisely the same site, one allele, wx-m5:CS7 ((Ds) (CS7), reverts germinally as much as 90 fold less than the other two even though all three alleles show the same frequent, somatic reversion in the endosperm. The suppression of CS7 germinal reversion is genetically linked to Wx, independent of the transposase source and does not suppress excision by Ds insertions at other loci, suggesting a cis-acting mutation subjecting the CS7 Ds to a novel type of developmental control. The overall hypothesis tested in this proposal is that, because of a mutation in the CS7 Ds, the host plant can now suppress this transposon by developmentally restricting how accessible it is to proper transposase binding. Specifically: 1. The Ds elements in SD7, CS8, and CS8311B will be sequenced and compared, 2. DNA methylation will be compared and the excision rate quantitated at different stages during plant development, 3. The interaction of the DS elements will be tested by assaying the suppressiol of CS7 germinal reversion in CS7/CS8 heterozygotes, 4. cis- and trans-acting factors controlling CS7 excision will be identified and 5. maize proteins that bind the CS7 Ds and the CS8 Ds differently will be identified.  %%%  The goal of this research is to understand genetic control mechanisms in plants by examining mechanisms whereby plants regulate transposable element activity and how they interact with each other. Three transposons of corn which have inserted into identical positions on the corn genome have different germinal excision frequencies although such frequencies are identical in somatic cells. Studies will be initiated to determine the mechanisms controlling such differences in the corn plant.

"9309555  Grober          Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a decapeptide that  was isolated from brain in 1971 and has now been shown to exist in  at least five different multiple forms.  Further, with the  development of sophisticated antibody technology, the GnRH neuronal  network was demonstrated to be a complex, heterogenous system,  comprising three or more distinct neuronal groups and spanning  vastly different regions of the brain.

"Mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of agents of disease to hundreds of millions of people each year.  Their large populations are the result of an efficient reproductive system that converts the protein contained in the blood that the female mosquito ingests into eggs.  When they mate with females, male mosquitoes transfer sperm as well as substances from their accessory reproductive glands and these substances alter the female's physiology.  Among their many effects, the male accessory gland substances prevent the females of most species from ever mating again.  After the first mating, sperm are stored in a special sac, the spermatheca, for the rest of her life and these are released to fertilize each batch of eggs as it is laid.  Recent work in this laboratory has demonstrated that in the most important mosquito vector of malaria, Anopheles gambiae, male accessory glands do not control mating behavior as they do in other mosquito species.  Mating does, however, somehow alter the female's behavior and the hydrocarbon composition of her cuticle, which may be the cue that males of this species use to distinguish unmated or previously mated females.   Preliminary experiments suggest that sperm contained in the spermatheca of the female may prevent her from remating.  Another interesting difference that emerged from this work was the demonstration of a sperm polymorphism in male An. gambiae; unlike most other mosquito species, male gambiae produce sperm of considerably variable lengths, but only the longer sperm end up in the female's spermatheca.<br/> The goals of this project are to examine the mechanism of cuticular alteration in An. gambiae, its role in mating, and the possible reasons for the varying types of sperm produced by the male.  The change in cuticular hydrocarbons of female mosquitoes will be assessed by gas chromatography after various experimental treatments and the degree to which mating is prevented will be determined.  Sperm that are produced by males after various treatments such as hormone administration will be examined microscopically and measured for length and presence of a nucleus, both within the genital tracts of the male and female.  The long-term importance of this project is that it will provide much needed information about the mating systems of the most important mosquito vector in the world.  If, using tools of genetic engineering, new genes are to be introduced into mosquito populations to prevent them from transmitting infectious agents, the basic mechanisms of mating by which those genes are to be introduced must be better understood.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,431493.00,431493,4900,PHYSIOLOG & STRUCTURAL SYS,0210251,,Marc J Klowden,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,mklowden@uidaho.edu,Marc,Klowden,,Dona Boggs,,['04000203DB NSF Education & Human Resource'],08/12/2002,08/15/2002,07/31/2006,Physiology of Mosquito Behavior,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Sanford D Eigenbrode'],J,,
"DEB-0075803<br/>N. Olof Pellmyr<br/><br/>Dr. N. Olof Pellmyr of Vanderbilt Univerisity, in collaboration with Dr. James H. Leebens-Mack of Colgate University, has beeen awarded a grant to study coveolutionary interactions between plants and moths.  Coevolution is an important process in driving diversification and speciation, but understanding of this process is hampered by a lack of phylogenies (family trees) for model groups of organisms.  Yuccas and yucca moths are tied in an obligate pollination mutualism, commonly cited as one of the most obvious examples of coevolution. The PIs propose to use multi-gene sequencing to complete robust organismal phylogenies for both yuccas (Agavaceae) and yucca moths (Prodoxidae: Lepidoptera). The results will be used to test hypotheses of coevolution, parallel speciation, and the role of host shifts in diversification.  Comparative analyses will be used to quantify coevolution at the level of individual traits in the moths and plants.  <br/><br/>The goal of objective 1 is to establish a stable phylogeny based on DNA sequence data for the plant genus Yucca. They will use a multi-gene approach, using both nuclear and cytoplasmic markers, to establish a robust species-level phylogeny. In objective 2, the PIs will use a similar approach to resolve relationships among a cluster of rapidly diversified groups of yucca moths whose origin coincided with much life history evolution. Objective 3 utilizes the moth and plant phylogenies to test hypotheses related to coevolution.  The distribution and frequency of cospeciation will be estimated, and and comparative analysis emplyed to test how host shifting and evolution of oviposition behavior affect diet breadth and rates of diversification.  Finally, the underlying conflict of interests between moth and plant should manifest through selection on traits with major effects on oviposition success in the moth and minimization of seed destruction in the plant.  Moth ovipositor shape, oviposition site, and floral ovary shape and thickness are candidate traits that are highly variable among species.  They will be the focus of ancestor reconstruction and comparative analyses to partition coevolutionary and phylogenetic components of diversification. <br/><br/>Together, the results from the project should provide the first phylogenetic framework at the species level for any of the models of coevolution and mutualism. It will open a venue for analyzing how coevolution acts at the trait level to contribute to the generation of biodiversity.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,92711.00,99961,4900,PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS,0242783,,N.

"A challenge in mathematics education is that students often do not see math as an opportunity for exploration and creativity. However, these tenets are central to how mathematicians engage in mathematics and could prove transformative in how students experience mathematics learning. Mathematicians identify and formalize patterns, develop and prove conjectures, and explore mathematical structures in creative and playful ways. Mathematical play can also be used to help students explore new ideas, experiment with different solutions, and develop mathematical reasoning. Mathematical play can also bolster motivation and engagement, which are critical factors in supporting students’ abilities to understand and persist in mathematics and the STEM fields. The project will investigate (a) how to meaningfully incorporate playful elements into the foundational secondary and undergraduate mathematics topics of algebra and calculus, and (b) the potential outcomes of “playifying” classroom mathematics for students’ learning and enjoyment. The project will investigate tasks that can be used for students to explore mathematical ideas such as rates of change, functions, derivatives, and integrals.<br/><br/>This study will examine the following traits of mathematical play: (a) exploration, (b) self-selection of goals, and (c) immersion, investment, and/or enjoyment. The research questions address students' mathematical activity, reasoning in algebra and calculus, the nature of mathematical play, and the learning benefits for students. In parallel to the student experience, the research questions also examine task design elements, pedagogical moves, and classroom features that support mathematical play. The project will implement a multi-phase design experiment model, leveraging clinical and stimulated recall interviews, small-scale teaching experiments, and whole-class teaching experiments, with each phase building on the findings of the prior. The research activities will produce a set of findings about the aspects of task design, instruction, and classroom interactions that support mathematical play, as well as the learning benefits of mathematical play for adolescents and undergraduates.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.076,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,682196.00,341104,4900,ECR-EDU Core Research,2347821,,Robert Ely,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,ely@uidaho.edu,Robert,Ely,mhjalmar@nsf.gov,Margret Hjalmarson,7032925186,['04002425DB NSF STEM Education'],08/02/2024,08/15/2024,07/31/2028,Collaborative Research: Characterizing and Fostering Playful Mathematics for Undergraduate and High School Learning,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,,
"In natural ecosystems, resources are not uniformly available across space and time. Consequently, animals must adjust their behavior in response to changing environmental conditions to maximize survival and reproductive success. Theory holds that the ability to make such adjustments should be constrained by body size, because fundamental traits such as energy requirements are strongly influenced by size. Nevertheless, how body size limits animals' ability to respond to environmental variation remains poorly understood. This research will improve understanding of (a) how body size limits the range of behaviors available to animals for coping with environmental change or variation, and (b) how the distribution of resources such as food, concealment cover from predators, and favorable microclimates interacts with behavior to determine the success of individuals and populations that differ in body size. The project is based in Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park, which was devastated during civil war (1977-1992) and is being rehabilitated with assistance from USAID and other agencies, in light of recognition that stability in eastern Africa and cessation of the illegal ivory trade are vital to U.S. interests. Beyond this specific ecosystem, the study will yield generalizable insights that can inform the management and conservation of North American species with high recreational and economic value (e.g., deer, elk, and moose) that also span a range of body sizes. Finally, the project facilitates STEM training and education for U.S. students alongside Mozambican students in an international setting, which will contribute to the development of a diverse and globally engaged STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Behavioral plasticity is constrained by morphology and physiology; because these often scale allometrically with body size, so should behavior. Indeed, the allometry of behavior is predicted to emerge from the interaction of (a) size-varying traits that influence animal performance (e.g., energy requirements), and (b) biotic and abiotic habitat attributes, such as the distribution of resources and microclimates. This project integrates observational, experimental, molecular, and modeling approaches to shed new light on the mechanisms that underpin animal behavior and population dynamics in an African savanna ecosystem that is both spatially and seasonally heterogeneous. The study system (Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique) is characterized by spatially patterned termite mounds that govern the distribution of vegetation, nutrients, and microclimates at broad spatial scales, and that are heavily used by three congeneric antelope species (bushbuck, nyala, and kudu, all Tragelaphus spp.) that vary five-fold in body size. This combination of factors presents an ideal opportunity to study the effects of body size and resource distribution on behavior and population dynamics. The unifying concepts of allometric scaling and resource heterogeneity mean that our insights will be generalizable and applicable across ecosystems, including to the management of North American wildlife populations. Broader impacts include development of an immersive, interdisciplinary field course offered to both U.S. and Mozambican students, broad public dissemination of research results via scientifically rigorous short films, and collaboration with park officials to develop effective wildlife-management policies.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,700000.00,717798,4900,Animal Behavior,1656642,,Ryan Long,,,MZ,"""""",Gorongosa National Park,,,ralong@uidaho.edu,Ryan,Long,jjawor@nsf.gov,Jodie Jawor,7032927887,"['01002223DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001718DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",07/26/2017,08/15/2017,07/31/2022,Collaborative Research: Allometry of Behavior in Spatially Patterned Resource Landscapes,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,"['Ecological monographs~2022~~Daskin, Josh H. and Becker, Justine A. and Kartzinel, Tyler R. and Potter, Arjun B. and Walker, Reena H. and Eriksson, Fredrik A.A. and Buoncore, Courtney and Getraer, Alexander and Long, Ryan A. and Pringle, Robert M.~~~~~~Allometry of behavior and niche differentiation among congeneric African antelopes~~~10362737~10362737~OSTI~2022-10-06 21:03:59.860~', 'Journal of Animal Ecology~2019~88~Branco, Paola_S and Merkle, Jerod_A and Pringle, Robert_M and Pansu, Johan and Potter, Arjun_B and Reynolds, Alana and Stalmans, Marc and Long, Ryan_A and Fryxell, ed., John~https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12971~~~~~Determinants of elephant foraging behaviour in a coupled human‐natural system: Is brown the new green?~~~10109393~10461393~OSTI~2024-07-15 08:00:48.346~', 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences~2022~119~Pansu, Johan and Hutchinson, Matthew C. and Anderson, T.

Yet, relationships between behavior and body size are often difficult to detect and interpret owing to variation in phylogenetic history and environmental context. Under this award we overcame these constraints by studying the movement and foraging behavior of three closely related species of spiral-horned antelope that differed in body mass?bushbuck (26-40 kg), nyala (57-83 kg), and kudu (80-142 kg)?in an African savanna ecosystem (Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique) where high-quality browse was strongly associated with patchily distributed termite mounds, and where predation risk was low due to the extirpation of several large carnivores.  At the time of this report, a total of 9 peer-reviewed publications have been generated under this award in prominent journals such as Ecology (1), Ecological Monographs (2), PNAS (1), and Science (2). Key findings from our work include:   The scaling of behavior with body size drives cryptic patterns of niche differentiation among closely related antelope species. Predator extirpation led to the expansion of bushbuck, a small, forest-dwelling antelope, into open floodplain habitat, disrupting a trophic cascade. Variation in both resource distribution and nutritional condition of individual antelope drove patterns of intraspecific specialization (i.e., forage selection). Plant traits underpin dietary partitioning among savanna herbivores.  Intense poaching during the Mozambican Civil War drove the rapid evolution of tusklessness in female African elephants.    The near-universal role of body size in structuring animal communities suggests that many of our conclusions are generalizable to other systems, and that our results will continue to have important impacts on the advancement of ecological theory related to (1) niche partitioning and co-existence, (2) trophic interactions and the mechanisms that underpin them, (3) scaling relationships of behavior and physiology with animal body size, (4) the role of resource distribution in modulating ecological patterns and processes, and (5) the role of individual state in modulating behavioral decisions in the face of complex tradeoffs.     Broader Impacts  This award supported 2 female (1 PhD, 1 MS; 1 international) and 1 male (non-traditional, active-duty U.S. Air Force Officer) graduate students and 3 senior theses (2 of whom went on to PhD programs, 1 to vet school). Work from this award was featured in a 6-part documentary series (Gorongosa Park: Rebirth of Paradise) on PBS and was the primary focus of an Emmy-nominated PBS NOVA documentary (Nature?s Fear Factor). Our study of tusklessness in Gorongosa elephants was featured in ~300 news articles, and other papers from our work under this award also received wide media coverage.  This award also provided multiple outstanding opportunities to generate increased interest in and excitement about science and STEM careers among members of underrepresented groups. Through a series of prison lectures (through UI's continuing education program), multiple presentations at summer camps for children with developmental disabilities, and presentations and workshops at science camps/fairs for Native American GK-12 students, the PI and his graduate students were able to use the work we conducted under this award as an effective means of promoting STEM to many potential students who might otherwise never consider such career paths.

"This project seeks to advance understanding of land surface response to climate change through study of evolving landforms on the Hawaiian islands. This research will improve scientists’ ability to decipher the record of past climates from landforms and to anticipate land surface response to future climate change. Planned research activities focus on the role of extreme events in canyon cutting – a topic that is central to landscape response to climate change but has received insufficient attention. The team will recruit two undergraduates from underrepresented communities in Hawaii to participate in the research effort and to attend an international professional conference to learn about opportunities and establish network connections. Outreach and hands-on public educational activities will be developed at both Arizona State University and the University of Indiana, including through participation of undergraduates in research efforts. All resulting research data will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>This research will extend prior studies of the Hawaiian islands by examining landscapes across a span of islands, and thus landscape ages, and across the dramatic differences in rainfall between windward and leeward slopes, emphasizing the role of geomorphic thresholds and the extreme events that can exceed them. Preliminary investigation indicates that the kilometer-deep canyons common to all of the islands were cut rapidly to depths similar to the present day, after which incision stagnated because channel gradient decreased below a climate-dependent threshold for moving large boulders in channels. This study will systematically test the hypothesis that canyon cutting on the Hawaiian islands has been limited by boulder transport thresholds. A combination of methods will be deployed, including detailed field measurements, digital elevation model analyses, 40Ar/39Ar dating of inset lava flows, and estimates of catchment-mean erosion rates from cosmogenic 36Cl in magnetite in river sediment – a novel method only recently developed. This research represents an opportunity to advance understanding of climatic control on landscape evolution in general, and to quantify how fluvial incision thresholds critically modulate connections among climate, topography, and erosion rate. The Hawaiian islands provide unique conditions to directly measure fluvial thresholds and to quantitatively assess their role modulating climatic control of landscape evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,208292.00,208292,4900,Geomorphology & Land-use Dynam,2229223,,Elowyn Yager,875 PERIMETER DRIVE MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,eyager@uidaho.edu,Elowyn,Yager,ramartin@nsf.gov,Raleigh Martin,7032927199,['01002324DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],06/06/2023,08/15/2023,07/31/2025,Collaborative Research: Climatic Control of Erosion Rates and Landscape Morphology - Quantifying the Influence of Fluvial Thresholds,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,,
"In 2010, the observatory at Summit, Greenland, in the center of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS), was expanded to include a comprehensive suite of cloud-atmosphere observing instruments including microwave and infrared spectrometers, cloud radar, depolarization lidar, ceilometer, precipitation sensor, sodar, and a twice-daily radiosonde program. This observing effort was termed ICECAPS (Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state, and Precipitation at Summit).  A continuation of this project is proposed here, with moderate enhancements to include atmospheric aerosol observations. Measurements from this expanded instrument suite will be used to derive critical baseline atmospheric data products including:<br/>* Atmospheric State - tropospheric temperature, moisture, and wind profiles<br/>* Aerosols - concentration of total particles and cloud condensation nuclei<br/>* Cloud Macrophysics - occurrence, vertical boundaries, temperature<br/>* Cloud Microphysics - phase, water content, and characteristic particle size<br/>* Precipitation - type and rate<br/>Together these products, when combined with similar ongoing measurements at Summit, can be used to study processes that impact the surface energy budget and precipitation at the site, as well as addressing questions related to atmospheric stability, cloud phase composition, the persistence of stratiform clouds, and aerosol-cloud interactions. It is further anticipated that these observations will continue to be used by a broad cross-section of the scientific community to promote understanding of GIS and Arctic climate, validate satellite observations, and evaluate model simulations.  Graduate students play significant roles in most aspects of this project, gaining valuable experience with polar field work, operating instruments, and processing data.

"Proposal No.: 1454411 <br/>CAREER: Mixed Signal Photonics Integrated Circuits for Energy-Efficient High-Speed Data Interfaces<br/>Vishal Saxena (Boise State University)<br/><br/>Abstract: This research harnesses photonics to satisfy ever-growing government, industry, and consumer needs for data bandwidth, while significantly reducing the increasingly voracious energy footprint that accompanies Internet cloud use. Photonics uses light instead of electronics to perform a variety of functions such as information processing and transfer. While most of us still work in offices and meet friends in person, mobile and networking device capability has enabled massive online business and social transaction growth. The Internet and its cloud-based services are used for production systems, banking, entertainment, social interaction, information distribution and research. Resulting information accumulation is fueling the rise of ""big data,"" as well as the powerful correlation tools that help analysts spot financial trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and improve quality of research. More and more, we put content in the cloud for easy access from anywhere and at any time, with data growing exponentially. All this data transfer uses a surprising amount of energy. To reduce data center energy consumption while increasing data capacity by over ten fold, this research will investigate novel hybrid data communication interfaces, using light rather than electrons to process and transfer data at higher speeds. The potentially explosive increase in data rates enabled by these hybrid photonic interconnects could lead to several transformative applications, such as future exascale data centers, terabit speed local area networks, and massively-parallel computing for big data applications. These hybrid photonic interconnects will not only have a broad impact on the semiconductor industry, but also US energy sustainability and security, as more energy-efficient computing systems would reduce carbon footprint of the Internet cloud. Further, to prepare students for the workforce with the necessary skills to drive future technology, the project includes a strong educational component. Interactive learning methods will be employed to teach electronic circuits and to bring photonics to integrated circuit design. The project also incorporates a high school outreach program, with an annual Smart Environments for Sustainability-themed one-week summer camp for high school students that commits to fostering women and minority group representation in integrated circuit design.<br/><br/>Technology development leveraging integrated photonic circuits and optical interconnects has thus far largely focused on binary communication using silicon photonic modulators. To enable future optical interconnects for higher data rates and energy-efficiency, researchers must reconsider the hybrid integrated circuit paradigm. An important technology enabler is the high-speed signal processing capability of integrated photonic devices. The research approach will first be to develop a photonic design kit with standard cell libraries and compact models to enable large scale integration of photonic devices into hybrid integrated circuits. Researchers will employ photonic device high-speed optical domain signal processing into novel circuit configurations, exploit synergistic interaction between electronic and photonic components, and form a mixed-signal photonic architecture.

Research outcomes will empower integrated circuit researchers by equipping them with a new photonics expertise to tackle nano-scaled technology design challenges, where data transfer bottlenecks constrain system performance.

"Recent climate warming has resulted in profound environmental changes in the Arctic, including shrub-cover expansion, permafrost thawing, and sea-ice shrinkage. These changes foreshadow more dramatic impacts that will occur if the warming trend continues. Among the major challenges in anticipating these impacts are ?surprises? in system components that have remained relatively stable in the observational record (typically past few decades in arctic regions). Tundra burning is potentially one such component. Available evidence suggests that ongoing climate and vegetation change could significantly increase tundra burning. For example, preliminary findings reveal temperature and moisture thresholds, which may be crossed to result in burning rates that far exceed those witnessed in the observational record. In addition, a marked increase in shrub abundance is changing the physiognomic structure of arctic regions such that future tundra fire regimes may differ vastly from modern. Thus tundra burning is emerging as a key process in the rapidly changing Arctic, and knowledge of tundra fire-regime responses to climate change is essential for projecting Earth system dynamics, developing ecosystem management strategies, and preparing arctic residents for future change.<br/><br/>The short duration of observational fire records, paucity of fire-history studies, and possibility of novel future climate and vegetation greatly hinder our ability to evaluate how tundra fire regimes may respond to future climate and vegetation change. Paleoecological analysis and ecological modeling circumvent these limitations and offer the only ways to acquire such information. This research takes advantage of the complementary properties of paleoecological and modeling approaches to (1) quantify historic climate-vegetation-fire relationships in the tundra ecosystems of the North American Arctic, (2) conduct multi-proxy analyses of lake sediments to reconstruct tundra fire regimes during periods of the late Glacial and Holocene with novel combinations of climate and vegetation, (3) reparameterize ALFRESCO, a landscape ecosystem model initially developed to study the response of subarctic vegetation to changes in climate and fire regimes, for predicting tundra fire regimes under the suite of IPCC climate scenarios for the 21st century, (4) modify ED, a state-of-the-art physiologically-based model for tundra ecosystem studies, and (5) couple ED with ALFRESCO to simulate carbon dynamics related to 21st-century shifts in tundra fire regimes. Each of these elements is at the forefront of ongoing research in the respective areas, and together they promise to substantially advance our knowledge of climate-vegetation-fire interactions of tundra ecosystems for the past, present, and future.<br/><br/>The consequences of altered fire regimes in tundra ecosystems are rarely considered by the scientific community, largely because tundra fires occur infrequently on the modern landscape. Fire managers in the Arctic lack the most fundamental knowledge about the fire regimes of tundra ecosystems (e.g., fire return intervals) for the design and implementation of landscape-level fire and fuels management plans. This research addresses this issue directly. The prognostic simulations of the 21st century fire regime will provide information directly relevant to fire management planning and policy in Alaska. The researchers will collaborate with scientists from federal management agencies through this project. This partnership promotes an improved understanding of the range of past, present, and future climate-fire relationships by federal and state natural resource managers.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.078,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,456612.00,456612,4900,ARCSS-Arctic System Science,1023669,,Philip E Higuera,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,philip.higuera@umontana.edu,Philip,Higuera,,Neil R.

These changes foreshadow more dramatic impacts that will occur if the warming trend continues. Among the major challenges in anticipating these impacts are ""surprises"" in system components that have remained relatively stable in the observational record (typically the past few decades in the Arctic). Tundra burning is potentially one such component. Available evidence suggests that ongoing climate and vegetation change could significantly increase tundra burning.     To understand the potential for tundra burning to increase in a warming Arctic, we studied the patterns of tundra fires and the link between fire and climate across Alaska, over the 60-yr observational record, and then deeper into the past using charcoal preserved in lake-sediment records that extend back 2000-36,000 years before present. Our results highlight the importance of summer temperature and seasonal or annual moisture in determining when and where tundra burning occurs. Over the past 60 years, the duration of the observational record, tundra regions characterized by average summer temperatures above 13.4 C were significantly more likely to burn than regions below this threshold. Likewise, in any given year, extensive tundra burning was associated with mean summer temperatures above 11 C and total summer precipitation below approximately 150 mm. Above (temperature) or below (moisture) these thresholds, the likelihood of tundra burning increased rapidly. These thresholds to burning help explain the variability observed across modern tundra and tundra regions in the deeper past. Locations that have burned most frequently over the past 60 years have also been prone to burning over the past several thousand years, suggesting that climate in non-flammable tundra has remained below these temperature thresholds.     The modern relationships between climate and tundra burning have important implications for tundra burning under future climate warming. We used a suite of future climate scenarios to inform our statistical models linking climate to tundra burning, which allowed us to characterize the potential magnitude and spatial pattern of burning given 21st-century climate changes. Whereas over the last 60 years there was a 7% chance of having a ""large"" tundra fire season, defined as a summer with over 1000 km2 of tundra burned, this probability will increase to 13-23% over the next 90 years (based five general circulation models, run under a single climate change scenario). Our work also highlights that these changes will not be uniform across Alaska, with the probability of burning in some tundra regions higher than at any time in the observational or paleoecological record. The consequences of increased tundra burning are only beginning to be understood, but observations after recent large tundra fires suggests that tundra burning releases significant amounts of carbon from vegetation and soils, and impacts the physical and biological makeup of tundra for years to decades.    In addition to these scientific findings, our project helped train the next generation of scientists, involving students from the undergraduate through postdoctoral stages of professional development. The project provided partial support for two (female) postdoctoral scientists, three PhD students (one female), and three MS students. Two PhD students working on the project obtained competitive graduate fellowships to extend their work beyond the scope of this project (i.e., EPA STAR, and NASA Earth and Space Science programs). The project also engaged a number of undergraduate students in research and scientific discovery, through field work, lab work, and integrating project findings into course materials.

"Power systems are changing with the rapid deployment of remote sensing devices such as Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) and integration of more capable Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. PMU measurements, generated every second, are used by power system operators to make critical decisions. With more utilities adopting PMUs for real-time system monitoring, power systems are exposed to more cyber-threats targeting these devices.<br/><br/>This research investigates means to determine the impacts of data intrusion on PMU devices, and will propose mitigation strategies. The outcomes will identify cyber-attacks that can result in cascading blackouts as well as the most critical components of power systems that are likely to be targeted by cyber threats. This multidisciplinary research will focus on three fundamental goals: (1) Quantifying the impact and severity of false data injection; (2) Detection of anomalies; and (3) Mitigation of the impacts. The project delineates differences between trivial and critical data manipulations and evinces the need to protect some measurements more than others. The project will systematically identify the most critical power system measurements that are best candidates for additional protection.<br/><br/>The findings of this research will establish the foundations for protecting the most critical assets in power grids. As part of the broader impacts of this research, a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students, especially women and underrepresented students can be trained in smart grid protection and planning.

"Funding is provided to help the researchers build on success using ice cores for understanding past physical and chemical climate change from Antarctica, Arctic, North Pacific and Asia by analyzing and interpreting a new array of Asian ice cores. The researchers plan to use five existing ice cores and collect one new ice core to enhance the reconstruction of environmental conditions over Asia. <br/><br/>The primary research questions for the Asian Ice Core Array (AICA) research include: <br/><br/>(1) Asian climate variability - How do major Asian circulation features (i.e., Asian monsoon, Westerlies, polar air masses, Siberian and Tibetan Highs) vary on annual to longer scales? What factors (i.e., solar variability, volcanic activity, greenhouse gases) control changes in the major circulation features impacting Asia? What is the association between Asian climate and global circulation features? Can Asian climate be simulated and predicted from the state of past atmospheric circulation patterns (analog modeling)? How does the interaction between tropical and extra-tropical circulation impact climate over Asia? What are the regional climatic changes to be expected in near future based on trends? Are Asian climate change events related to climate change in other regions?<br/><br/>(2) Environmental change over Asia - How have natural versus anthropogenic sources for chemical species notably sulfate, nitrate, and select heavy metals and trace and major elements varied in the atmosphere over central Asia? Are spatial and temporal variations in contaminants related to changes in contaminant source areas or production? Have changes in atmospheric circulation impacted distribution of chemical species in the atmosphere over central Asia?<br/><br/>Scientifically, ice cores from Asian glaciers could provide a source of high-resolution records of seasonal to millennial climate dynamics and atmospheric chemistry. This is important because the Eurasian continent is the largest landmass in the World and exerts substantial influence on atmospheric and terrestrial systems and the 2.5 billion people living in the region. Changes in environment over this region could have dramatic impacts on humans and ecosystems. Unpredictable changes in water resources and desertification over this heavily populated region may have significant global consequences. The results from AICA could be of interest to climatologists, paleoclimatologists, atmospheric chemists, geochemists, climate modelers, solar-terrestrial physicists, and environmental statisticians. <br/><br/>Educationally, the research project will support two PhD students as well as several undergraduate students for three years.

The majority of molecular chaperones assist the folding of proteins that are mostly unfolded. The abundant, essential molecular chaperone Hsp90 (heat shock protein, 90 kDa) is unique among chaperones because it preferentially interacts with and is required for the activity of proteins that are almost completely folded. The client proteins that require Hsp90 for function have little or no sequence or structural homology, and little is known about how Hsp90 promotes activation of a select group of diverse cellular client proteins. The goal of this project is to identify the sites of interaction between Hsp90 and two very different client proteins. A panel of mutant forms of Hsp90 will be used as tools to identify and describe critical features of Hsp90 required for interaction with a protein kinase and a transcription factor. Once mutations that disrupt the interaction with two distinct client proteins in vivo are identified, further research will determine whether the mutations disrupt the in vitro assembly of Hsp90-client protein complexes using cell lysates and purified components. Additional research will focus on establishing whether select Hsp90 mutations indirectly disrupt client protein interaction by preventing interaction of Hsp90 with regulatory co-chaperone proteins. This research project will lead to clarification of the contact sites between Hsp90 and client proteins and a greater understanding of how Hsp90 and co-chaperones cooperate to promote activation of a diverse group of client proteins. This project will have broad impacts on understanding how Hsp90 interacts with diverse client proteins. This project will enable one graduate student and two undergraduate students per year to conduct independent research projects. All students will have the opportunity to develop skills in organizing and presenting data during laboratory meetings, undergraduate research poster forums and/or additional scientific conferences. Additional graduate and undergraduate students outside of this lab will be exposed to this work through scientific exchanges and seminars among faculty members within the Microbiology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry department, and the Center for Reproductive Biology, which is a joint program with Washington State University.

Hsp90 works with a set of 10 or more helper proteins or co-chaperones, some of which compete for the same binding site on Hsp90.  This award focused on determining whether these helper proteins have identical, unique or overlapping functions. We characterized the impact of loss of Hsp90 or co-chaperones function on  several client proteins that require Hsp90 for folding.  We identified new functions of ten of the co-chaperones and identified important parts of the co-chaperone proteins.  Surprisingly, most of those functions were unique to specific co-chaperones.  We also identified specific mutations in Hsp90 that are critically dependent on specific co-chaperones, demonstrating the importance of cooperation between Hsp90 and the co-chaperones during protein folding.  Our studies indicate that different misfolded proteins require different co-chaperones. This suggests that it may be possible to develop compounds to inhibit some, but not all functions of Hsp90.  In addition, our studies indicate that co-chaperones interact with different forms of Hsp90, although we do not yet understand what those differences are.   Finally, we developed an extensive set of tools to help analyze Hsp90 function, and have already shared many of those reagents with other researchers.   This award provided training opportunities for two graduate students and ten undergraduate researchers. All students gained experience in conducting independent research projects and presenting their research in poster format or during lab meetings.

"0075944<br/>Pellmyr<br/>Mutualistic interactions create resources that are exploited by parasites. These parasites sometimes evolve from mutualists and they can greatly alter the dynamics of the interactions. Obligate mutualisms, such as those between seed-parasitic pollinators and their hosts, make excellent models for the study of such reversals because of their simplicity. This study will use a recently evolved cheater yucca moth and its pollinating sister species to test the first explicit scenario for any obligate mutualism of how it can evolve. In this scenario, specific life history traits and ecological context are suggested to greatly facilitate this type of diversification. The project has three objectives. First, the study will use phylogenetic analysis based on mtDNA and morphometric data to test explicit hypotheses about changing geographic ranges and history of coexistence between the cheater, two pollinators, and their shared host over the last 2-3 million years. Second, experiments will be used to test the hypothesis that the pollinator that gave rise to the cheater has requisite behavioral plasticity and ovipositor morphology to make the shift from pollinator to cheater habit comparatively easily. Third, the study will test a hypothesis suggesting that offset emergence phenology between coexisting pollinators facilitates the evolution of cheating in the later species. Taken together, this project would place a multi-species mutualism in its historical biogeographic context, and use a very recent case of evolution of cheating within that mutualism as a template to experimentally test specific but generalizable hypotheses about this ecologically important process of diversification.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,127266.00,127266,4900,POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG,0242778,,N.

"Abstract<br/>Pellmyr/Seagraves<br/><br/>This project will expand dissertation research on the circumstances leading to cheating in mutualistic interactions by testing explicit hypotheses on geographically structured coevolution and history.  The obligate pollination mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths is one of the classical examples of coevolution, and an excellent model system to explore mutualism reversal as it includes derived non-pollinating 'cheater' moths.  Using this interaction, three specific predictions will be tested on how local adaptation drives variation in plant-moth interactions and coevolution.  The project will specifically focus on phylogeography and floral morphology of the host plant Yucca filamentosa.  Phylogeographic analysis based on AFLP data will be performed across the plant range, and the results used to test hypotheses that involve comparisons with existing data sets on floral trait variation and moth phylogeographic patterns.

"SBR-9719410  Morgan  University of Idaho    This three-year, collaborative, multi-disciplinary research project reconstructs the fire, vegetation, and climate history of the sub-alpine forests of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area in northern Idaho and western Montana over 2,000 years.  Its purpose is to examine the linkages among climate, fire regimes, and vegetation composition at different temporal and spatial scales.    The variation in and interaction of  climate, fire, and vegetation shape the landscape.  The processes of interaction vary according to the temporal and spatial scale of analysis.  At century-to-millennial temporal scales and at landscape-to-regional spatial scales, large changes in climate determine fire regime and vegetation composition.  The linkages between fire and vegetation at these gross scales is less clear.  At annual-to-decadal temporal scales and at the watershed spatial scale, fire frequency, size, and severity are determined by climate/weather, vegetation, and ignition frequency.  In these finer scales, the linkages between fire and vegetation are fairly well developed:  vegetation determines fuel availability, and fires create a landscape pattern that shapes vegetation recovery.    Investigators will derive information on the frequency of past fires from charcoal and pollen data in lake sediments, tree-ring records, and tree-stand age information.  They will calibrate the lake-sediment and tree-ring records against historical fire maps, to estimate the spatial extent of fires.  The data will be compiled at the watershed, landscape, and regional scales.  They will develop climate reconstructions from Pinus albicaulis and Larix lyalli tree-ring-width chronologies for the last 300+ years in each watershed.  These reconstructions should yield an understanding of fire chronology and synoptic climatic conditions giving rise to prehistoric fires.      In the western United States, whether late-twentieth-century fire regimes reflect a shift in climate, a product of  human activity, or current management practices is a topic of scientific and public-policy debate.  This research should provide data on fire history, vegetation, and climate, and move toward understanding the temporally and spatially specific processes of interaction among these elements.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.075,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,62860.00,62860,4900,Geography and Spatial Sciences,9619410,,Penelope Morgan,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,pmorgan@uidaho.edu,Penelope,Morgan,,Thomas Baerwald,,,08/27/1997,08/15/1997,07/31/2002,Collaborative Research: Climate-Fire-Ecosystem Linkages on  Decadal to Centennial Time Scales in the Northern Rockies,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,,
"Both the Greenland and Scandinavian Caledonides expose huge slabs of continental crust that have experienced high-pressure (HP) metamorphism during the collision between Laurentia and Baltica. An ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) terrane has been recognized in western Norway for the past fifteen years, while the first evidence for UHP metamorphism has just been found in Greenland a few months ago. Taken together, these two coherent continental eclogite terranes comprise the most extensive exposure of a deep, ancient mountain root on the planet - giving us a view of mountain belt anatomy that is generally hidden at the base of active orogens like the Himalayas. The ultimate goal of this project is to understand how this thick or deep orogenic root formed, and how it was brought back up to the earth's surface. Extensional collapse of overthickened crust, whereby HP and UHP rocks are unroofed along listric normal faults, is an oft-cited mechanism of exhumation; however, major extensional structures are not exposed in the Geenland eclogite province. Gilotti's earlier NSF supported research found that the peak pessure was attained approximately 410 to 370 Ma ago; whereas, workers in the Fjord Region, to the south of the eclogite province, are finding widespread evidence of synchronous melting, leucogranite generation and extensional faulting that is 10-70 Ma older. Either the observed extensional detachments in the south have nothing to do with eclogite exhumation, or the PI's previous ages are recording cooling at the end of the exhumation path instead of peak pressure conditions. The main objectives of the proposed research are: 1) to identify the extent and timing of UHP metamorphism; 2) to test the robustness of our previous ages for HP metamorphism by comparing zircon populations from the retrograde margins of eclogite pods to zircon populations from the well-preserved centers; 3) to establish the pressure-temperature-time history of this slab of eclogite-bearing crust as it returns to the earth's surface; and 4) to determine the geometry and timing of contractional and strike-slip fabrics that might be possible exhumation structures. The PI's data set is essential for formulating an orogen-wide model of eclogite formation and exhumation in this important continent-continent collision. Although the necessary studies are underway in Norway, their results cannot be put into context without the corresponding knowledge of HP and UHP metamorphism in Greenland. The preliminary results also have the potential to provide new insight on the behavior of U-Pb isotope systems during HP/UHP metamorphism and subsequent decompression.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,162310.00,162310,4900,Tectonics,0208158,,William McClelland,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,bill-mcclelland@uiowa.edu,William,McClelland,,David Fountain,,,08/01/2002,08/15/2002,07/31/2006,Collaborative Research: Formation and Exhumation of UHP and HP Terranes in the Greenland Caledonides - Understanding Processes at the Base of Continental Collisions,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,,

"This research will characterize the structural forms, substrate                 specificities, enzyme reaction kinetics, and catalytic mechanisms of            action of a group of extracellular lignin peroxidases produced by               ligninolytic Streptomyces species.  It is also intended to express and          amplify expression of the lignin-induced peroxidase of Streptomyces             viridosporus by gene cloning in order to better define the role of              this lignin oxidizing enzyme in lignin degradation and solubilization.          The lignin-induced peroxidase gene of S. viridosporus will also be              compared for sequence homologies with the lignin peroxidase gene of             Phanerochaete chrysosporium using gene probes.                                                                                                                  This research will increase scientific understanding of how plant               residues are decomposed by microorganisms.  Ultimately, the knowledge           gained will lead to the development of economically viable                      technologies by which plant residues can be used to produce useful              chemicals biologically, and to new technologies for carrying out                industrial processes such as paper and chemical production using less           energy and producing less toxic chemical wastes as by-products.  In             turn, the research can, therefore, lead to a less energy intensive              industry in the United States, which will help to reduce our                    dependence on the burning of fossil fuels, a major source of the                carbon dioxide which is creating the greenhouse effect and undesirable          warming of the Earth.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,100000.00,100000,4900,BIOCHEMICAL & BIOMASS ENG,8807000,,Donald L Crawford,,,,"""""",,,,donc@uidaho.edu,Donald,Crawford,,Dov Jaron,,,08/04/1988,08/15/1988,01/31/1991,Enzymology of Lignin Metabolism in Actinomycetes,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,L,,

"Biologists have long sought explanations for why some groups of species on Earth are so much more diverse than others. This project will study the way that new species have formed and changed across different vertebrate groups throughout the history of life. New statistical methods will be developed to measure rates of speciation, extinction, and trait change across the jawed vertebrates, a large group of animals that includes fishes, mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Using new information obtained from NSF's Assembling the Tree of Life program, the project will identify groups with unusually high diversity and test potential explanations for these <br/>""evolutionary explosions.""<br/><br/>This project will investigate the forces influencing evolutionary change over the past 500 million years of vertebrate history. Describing evolution at this scale will give us a broader understanding of life over time in general, and will be of great interest to many scientific fields.

"<br/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>This award supports a field campaign that will expand the Arctic Observing Network (AON) by adding cloud, atmosphere, and precipitation measurements, and associated higher-order data products, to Summit, Greenland, at the top of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The proposed instrument suite consists of a cloud radar, two microwave radiometers, an Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer, an X-band precipitation sensor, a ceilometer, a micropulse lidar, and a twice-daily radiosonde program. Measurements from this advanced suite of instruments, combined with some ongoing measurements at Summit, will be input for a number of algorithms to produce climatically useful geophysical data products to support GIS-specific and Arctic-wide research. Data products will include: (1) Atmospheric State - temperature and moisture profiles through the troposphere and lower stratosphere; (2) Cloud Macrophysics - cloud occurrence, vertical boundaries, and temperatures; (3) Cloud Microphysics - cloud phase, water content, optical depth, and particle size; (4) Precipitation - precipitation type and rate; and (5) Cloud Radiative Forcing - impact of clouds on the surface radiation balance. Together these products will augment similar data sets that are produced at other locations across the Arctic. It is anticipated and intended that these data sets will be widely used by the broader scientific community to understand the climates of the Greenland Ice Sheet and the broader Arctic Basin and to validate satellite retrievals and model simulations over Greenland. The ""Broader Impacts"" of this award are numerous. The proposed observations will contribute to the goals of the Study of Arctic Environmental Change (SEARCH). They will be the first of their kind on the Greenland Ice Sheet and will expand the existing, although modest, network of such measurements across the Arctic. Uncertainty in polar cloud properties is a major deficiency in current models of polar climate; the proposed observations of cloud macro- and micro-physics will provide some of the necessary constraints for improving model cloud algorithms. This project will provide important field work and data processing experience for graduate students at the University of Wisconsin, University of Colorado and University of Idaho. In addition, data and experiences from the field program will be integrated into undergraduate coursework at the University of Idaho and summer workshops at the University of Wisconsin.<br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.082,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,898138.00,898138,4900,AON-Arctic Observing Network,0856773,,Von P Walden,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,v.walden@wsu.edu,Von,Walden,,Erica L.

"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Zinc oxide (ZnO) is emerging as one of the materials of choice for ultraviolet (UV) applications, but only at a narrow energy range.  ZnO is attractive because it is a very efficient light-emitter in a wide range of temperatures, and has a benign chemical nature. Creating an alloy is one route for tailoring optical properties and achieving additional light emissions at desired energies. Thus alloying ZnO with certain atomic constituents can add new optical and electronic functionalities to ZnO. The optical properties of the alloys depend on their material quality, and on how amenable to mixing, or soluble, are the atomic constituents in the ZnO matrix. This project focuses on the study of two ZnO-based alloy systems, Mg(x)Zn(1-x)O and ZnS(1-x)O(x), with the objective of achieving high-quality alloys with known solubility and material properties that enable optical properties by design at energy ranges above and below that of pure ZnO, respectively. In particular, the alloys may provide materials with tunable bandgaps and new optical emissions in the deep-UV as well as in the blue-green spectral ranges.  This research has broader impact in the potential use of these alloys in the highly vital field of blue and UV semiconductor light sources and sensors, as well as in coating technologies for the protection of sensitive electronic devices operating in harsh environments.  As part of this research effort, an educational outreach program is also being initiated that presents a series of lectures to the local community on the role of materials in consumer technology. The educational effort is coordinated with a professor from the Department of Philosophy at the University of Idaho, whose expertise is in enhancing communication in cross-disciplinary research and on the transfer of scientific and technical knowledge to the general public.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: In this research, Mg(x)Zn(1-x)O with a high percentage of Mg composition that promotes the cubic phase is investigated with the goal of achieving bandgap engineered alloys in the UV range of  4 - 6 eV, while ZnS(1-x)O(x) is studied with the objective of creating materials with bandgap in the blue-green part of the visible spectrum. ZnS(1-x)O(x) is a highly-lattice mismatched alloy system, and may prove useful for enabling new electronic and optical properties, such as strong bandgap bowing into the visible spectrum, and modification of valence band to acceptor level separation for the case of doped samples.  For this research, sintered ceramics, as well as films that are grown via a sputtering technique, are synthesized.  Due to the different thermal equilibrium conditions of these two growth techniques, studying both types of materials is expected to yield comprehensive knowledge into key aspects of the alloys such as solubility limits, sample homogeneities, and metastabilities. The material properties are studied via several high-resolution atomic imaging techniques and X-ray diffraction, while the optical properties are studied via photoluminescence, Raman scattering, absorption, and infrared spectroscopy.  Additionally, Hall effect measurements are employed for the investigation of doped ZnS(1-x)O(x) for understanding the valence - acceptor levels relation. The experimental studies are complemented with analytical modeling. The outcome of this research enables the creation of materials with a broad range of bandgaps and new emission lines in an important part of the spectrum. Another significant impact of this research is that for the advancement of ZnO as a viable material in quantum-well based devices, knowledge concerning its alloy systems is necessary, as the alloy constitutes the barrier component. The research is a collaborative effort between two PIs from the University of Idaho and from nearby Washington State University. A postdoctoral researcher, one graduate student, and an undergraduate student are supported by and participate in this research. As the PIs are strongly committed to educational efforts, several other undergraduates from diverse backgrounds take part in the research. The two laboratories provide an excellent opportunity for the students and the postdoctoral researcher to gain basic knowledge in optical materials as well as be trained in cutting-edge research techniques.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.049,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,432931.00,432931,4900,CERAMICS,1202532,,Leah Bergman,Office of Sponsored Programs,Moscow,US,ID00,University of Idaho,ID,838443020,lbergman@uidaho.edu,Leah,Bergman,lmadsen@nsf.gov,Lynnette Madsen,7032924936,['01001213DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/14/2012,07/15/2012,06/30/2015,Tailoring the Functionality of ZnO via Highly Lattice Mismatched and Lattice Matched Alloying,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Matthew D McCluskey'],,"['Appl.

The objective of the study is to synthesize new semiconductor alloys with by-design bandgaps that enable light emissions and absorption at optical ranges which do not exist naturally. The bandgap of a semiconductor is a material property that may facilitate the absorption and emission of light.  The bandgap has a unit of wavelength (nm) or energy (eV), and usually its value corresponds to that of the absorption or the emission. The research is focused on ZnO-based alloys with optical properties spanning the deep-UV down to the visible blue part of the spectrum.  Figure 1 presents the optical spectrum and the range which is studied in this research.  I. The first part of the research is on the alloy system ZnO-MgO (zinc oxide - magnesium oxide). ZnO emits light in the lower UV-range of ~ 3.4 eV corresponding to a wavelength of 364 nm, while MgO emits light at the deep UV ~ 7.0 eV corresponding to 177 nm.  By alloying, i.e., mixing, ZnO with a certain percentage of MgO, one can achieve alloys with tunable bandgaps starting from that of ZnO up to that of MgO.  II. The other part of the research is on the alloy system ZnO-ZnS (zinc oxide - zinc sulfide). These alloys can have bandgaps spanning down to the visible blue part of the spectrum ~ 2.5 eV corresponding to 496 nm. This desirable feature is a result of the large differences in the atomic size and chemical properties of the oxygen and sulfur atoms.  However, these differences make the mixing harder to achieve, and the alloy can be easily phase-segregated into its original constituents ZnO and ZnS.  In comparison to the ZnO-MgO alloys, the ZnO-ZnS alloys are more challenging to grow, and further investigation is needed.  Outcome: The key outcome of our research is the realization of alloys with by-designed optical properties. Specifically, ZnO-based alloys were grown via the sputtering growth method, which is relatively cost-effective and easy to use and maintain. Figure 2 is a photograph of the sputtering system, and Figure 3 presents images of one of the samples grown via the sputtering approach. The bandgaps of the ZnO-MgO alloys were found to span the UV region of ~ 3.4 eV to 5.5 eV, while those of the ZnO-ZnS alloys span down to the visible region of ~ 3.4 eV to 2.7 eV. Figure 4 summarizes this results.  One graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow were supported via this grant, and several undergraduates participated in the research. The students and postdoc were actively involved in all aspects of the materials research, and moreover were trained in using and upgrading the sophisticated lab equipment. Figures 5 and 6 present the optical systems that enable the measurements of the bandgaps of the alloys.  Broader Impact: The ZnO-based alloys are relatively environmentally-friendly materials with the potential of being used as light emitters and absorbers.  The alloys can potentially be used as light sources in optical communication to enable broadband signal capabilities. The spot size in the UV-range is smaller than that of lasers operating in the visible range, and so highly compacted optical storage devices, i.e., DVD technology, can also be realized. In lighting technology the alloys can be employed as relatively safe sources for the production of white light. Additionally, the ZnO-based alloys have the potential to be used as light absorbers in a wide-range of energies (wavelengths) from the deep UV to the blue. This versatility may contribute to novel sensor and coating technologies.        Last Modified: 08/09/2015       Submitted by: Leah Bergman"
"Abstract 567  Armstrong  Idaho Native American Outreach Education    This NSF-Idaho EPSCoR Experimental Systemic Improvement (ESI)  initiative targets members of one of Idaho's educationally  disadvantaged minorities--the Native American (NA).  This is a  twelve-month science/mathematics/engineering/technology (SMET)  education partnership involving the University of Idaho (UI), the  Nez Perce and Coeur d'Alene tribes, the school and community  organizations affiliated with each tribe, the American Indian  Science and Engineering Society (AISES), and North Idaho College  (NIC).    The project focuses on four basic, systemic changes to the manner  in which SMET instruction is presented, supported and accepted in  small rural communities.  Under this initiative, scholastically  qualified NA high school students, plus high science/mathematics  teachers, a parent of each student, and two NA student teachers  will participate in an active hands-on summer of environmental  research, education and university experiences at UI.  The  environment is a topic of extreme interest to NA tribes in Idaho.   NA school and community professionals will assist in selection of  the participants and will provide team support and mentoring.   The summer experience will have a positive scholastic career  influence on the student, provide the teacher with a research  experience and additional classroom skills, encourage supportive  parental participation in the student education process, and  provide extraordinary pre-service experience for the student  teacher.  The summer laboratory and instructional period will be  followed by SMET-related educational activities throughout the  next academic year.  The post-summer team activities, coordinated  by the UI Project Director and supported by the school districts,  AISES and NIC, will include assessments, scholastic  guidance/counseling and professional group activities.

"Biological systems are inherently complex, composed of many interacting molecules. Even with knowledge of the properties of each individual component, these interactions create a challenge for predicting how changing one enzyme will affect the performance of the whole pathway and the growth of the organism. While synthetic biology has the potential to address certain critical national challenges, progress is hampered by a lack of mathematical models that can be used to guide the optimization of complex biological systems. This project works to optimize the mechanisms that incorporate carbon gas into cell material in order to develop an efficient organism for generating products such as fuels or pigments. The results of the experiments will then yield a computational model capable of predicting the effects of novel combinations of genes. This project will directly lead to specific improvements in an important biotechnological platform, while simultaneously demonstrating a generic approach to using computational biology to efficiently apply the power of genome editing to a variety of synthetic biology challenges. The project also will develop and disseminate computational tools via websites, publications, workshops, and classes that will make it easier for students and researchers to simulate and analyze metabolic networks to learn about fundamental quantitative concepts that underlie their function, and provide interdisciplinary training for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.   <br/><br/>Epistasis represents a critical challenge to optimizing biological systems. When mutational effects upon growth or product generation depend on the genetic background, assessing performance across the entire parameter space of any system of realistic size quickly becomes impossible. There is an immediate need for two linked developments: empirical techniques that can rapidly generate and assess rational, combinatorial variants, and kinetic modeling techniques to incorporate these data and to make predictions. This project will use this novel approach to optimize the function of the high-efficiency ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway that the team has successfully introduced into the model methanol-consuming organism, Methylobacterium extorquens. In this project, gene editing of a plasmid-encoded suite of enzymes will be performed along with deep sequencing to rapidly assess the fitnesses of a quarter-million genotypes with combinatorial variation in nine dimensions of expression.  The resulting epistasis data, combined with direct measurement of intracellular metabolite concentrations for select variant combinations, will be used to infer the numerous parameter values in the kinetic model, which then will be utilized to predict which regions of parameter space would be more or less flexible.  These parameter spaces will be targeted and compared in a second round of editing, experimentation and evaluation. <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,692761.00,692761,4900,Systems and Synthetic Biology,1714949,,Christopher J Marx,"875 Perimeter Drive, MS 3051",Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443051,cmarx@uidaho.edu,Christopher,Marx,drockcli@nsf.gov,David Rockcliffe,7032927123,['01001718DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],06/26/2017,07/15/2017,06/30/2022,"Collaborative Research: Deep-sequencing analysis of edited metabolic pathways to uncover, model, and overcome the epistatic constraints upon optimization",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Sergey Stolyar', 'Ankur Dalia']",J,"['Science~2019~365~Lee, Jessica A. and Marx, Christopher J.~10.1126/science.aay2727~~~~~Tales from the crypt(ic)~~318 to 319~10160593~10160593~OSTI~2020-06-10 13:01:58.0~', 'Current Issues in Molecular Biology~2019~33~Marx, Christopher J.~https://doi.org/10.21775/cimb.033.249~~~~~Experimental Evolution of Methylobacterium: 15 Years of Planned Experiments and Surprise Findings~~249 to 266~10354695~10354695~OSTI~2022-09-07 21:03:23.750~', 'Current Opinion in Microbiology~2018~45~Bruger, Eric L and Marx, Christopher J~https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2018.03.002~~~~~A decade of genome sequencing has revolutionized studies of experimental evolution~~149 to 155~10354697~10354697~OSTI~2022-09-07 21:03:23.816~']"," Microbes in nature evolve in complicated ways involving the joint effect of mutations to their existing genomes as well as through acquisition of foreign genes from other organisms. These two processes are also used in biotechnology, where improved strains often combine both alterations to existing genes and synthetic systems where new capacities are combined. In this work we have used one particular model system to explore how natural selection acts after central metabolism has been rewired. To our surprise, the population that recovered the best ability to grow on methanol evolved to simply substitute an existing enzyme that normally only was used for biosynthesis of certain amino acids to replace an enzyme that normally served to assimilate all the carbon into the cell. This enzyme is not nearly as good at this new job, but due to a mutation that allowed it to be greatly over-expressed, it sufficed to circumvent the original engineering design. While this represents, on one hand, a failure in terms of selecting for cells to use the intended new pathway, it also serves as a powerful lesson that metabolism can evolve in unpredictable ways. These lessons are critical as we seek to understand the change of organisms to natural pressures such as climate change or as we learn better ways to harness their biochemical capacities for sustainable use in industry.

"9310389  Shreeve  Professors Shreeve and Kirchmeier of the University of Idaho  will investigate the synthesis of fluorophosphazenes with  support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry Program.  Although synthetic phosphazene chemistry  has been a fertile area of research for many years, the  fluorophosphazenes have been relatively untouched.  Shreeve and  Kirchmeier will prepare cyclophosphazenes as well as  polyphosphazenes with fluorine atoms attached both to the  skeletal atoms as well as to substituent groups such as  fluoroalkoxides, fluorophenoxides, and fluoroalkyls.  Many of  the syntheses will take advantage of fluoro-organosilanes as  reagents to introduce the fluoro-groups into the phosphazenes.  It is anticipated that the phosphazenes, already a promising  class of compounds, will display improved properties in their  fluorinated forms.  %%%  There is a class of inorganic compounds, called the  phosphazenes, which are similar to organic compounds in the  sense that they are constructed around a skeleton of linked  atoms; however, instead of carbon atoms the skeleton is made  of alternating phosphorus and nitrogen atoms.  Phosphazenes can  be prepared both as discrete molecules and as polymers, and  they are finding certain commercial applications.  Just as  Teflon is related to simple organic compounds through the  replacement of hydrogen with fluorine atoms, in the present  research project a series of fluorine-substituted phosphazenes  will be prepared.  The basic chemistry of these compounds will  be explored, but it is anticipated that they will display  improved properties relative to their unfluorinated relatives.  ***",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.049,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,214800.00,219800,4900,SYNTHETIC INORGANIC,9310389,,Jean'ne M Shreeve,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,jshreeve@uidaho.edu,Jean'ne,Shreeve,,"Clarke-Williams, Mark K.",,,06/24/1993,07/15/1993,06/30/1996,Silicon Mediated Syntheses of Fluorophosphazenes and Other  Fluorinated Compounds,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Robert L Kirchmeier'],M,,
"Weil<br/>9808880<br/>An unusual maize mutation, Lowered Ac/Ds Germinal reversion (LAG1-0) has been identified and partially characterized in this laboratory. It will be used to address specific questions of the regulation of the frequency of Ac/Ds transposon excision and how it is affected by the different stages of development of the plant. Ds transposon-induced alleles that revert frequently in the endosperm of the maize typically revert frequently in gametes of the plant from that kernel. But in the presence of LAG1-), these same Ds alleles revert germinally about 100-fold less often than in non-mutant lag1+ plants, while reversion in endosperm remains unchanged. LAG1-0 is tightly linked to the waxy locus on chromosome 9, is a dominant mutation in a trans-acting product and affects Ds excision regardless of Ac transposase source. The degree to which LAG1-0 suppresses Ac/Ds excision becomes more severe in somatic tissues as development progresses. Whether LAG1-0 suppression is imposed on Ac/Ds specifically in the slowly dividing cells of the meristem at the beginning of development will be tested. The specific aims are: 1) to isolate and characterize the LAG1-0 mutation, 2) to define more clearly when and where in development the suppression of Ac/Ds excision occurs, 3) to more clearly define the genetic mechanisms involved in the suppression, 4) to identify other genes and factors that regulate this unusual pattern of gene expression.<br/><br/>Meristems of higher plants are dome-shaped populations of actively dividing, relatively undifferentiated cells that are, ultimately, the source of all cells in the plant. How these cells become differentiated during development must be a function of regulated gene expression but it is, as yet, not understood at the molecular level. The LAG1-0 mutation characteristics suggest that an Ac or Ds element has inserted into a gene relevant to this process and this hypothesis will be tested by further experimentation.

Twenty-five AGEP Alliances convened for the first National Research Meeting hosted in the Pacific Northwest. Team leadership was successful in meeting the project goals through activities developed to advance knowledge of diverse pathways in STEM and broadening participation initiatives. Team leadership developed a plan for sessions, created materials, invited plenaries and invited speakers, and organized activities. Key activities included plenaries, panel presentations, invited speakers, technical sessions, lightning talks, and poster sessions. NSF Informational sessions were scheduled throughout the program. These activities aimed to advance diverse pathways and develop a shared vision across AGEP Alliances. Together participants shared ideas and identified strategies that foster diverse pathways in STEM.  Intellectual Merit  Two nationally renowned speakers presented on career preparation and pathways into the professoriate. The first, Dr. Medheva Ghee, shared about her experiences and her engagement in broadening participation initiatives. The second plenary, Dr. Karen DePauw, gave an inspired talk on the transformation of graduate education through innovation and increased participation of diverse groups. Three expert scholars, Drs. Daniel Wildcat, Paula Groves Price, and Lisa Wolf-Wendel facilitated breakout sessions on traditional ecological knowledges, culturally sustained mentoring through critical race awareness, and work-life integration, respectively.  Interactive Technical Sessions involved brainstorming ideas around essential issues concerning career pathways across all institutional types in higher education. The five Technical Sessions were facilitated by meeting organizers to discuss and collect strategies from participants. There were three Concurrent Sessions scheduled for specific groups to work together. AGEP Alliances met with either the NSF program officers, the social science researchers, or evaluators group. During the AGEP social science research session, attendees discussed the role of the social science researcher in AGEP. Forming a coordinated dissemination strategy to reach a wider audience was considered a high need among the group. The evaluation session discussed the mechanics and challenges of implementing high quality, culturally responsive, relevant, and methodologically appropriate evaluations of AGEP activities, outcomes, and impacts.  Fourteen AGEP Alliance participants presented research results from the NSF funded AGEP program. Most of the research models showcased aligned with the theme, Diverse Pathways in STEM: Achieving the Dream. The Lightning Research Talks and Poster Sessions included socially informed research models, policies, and practices to promote sustainability and reproducibility. Twenty-two of the fourteen participants also presented research posters.  Conference agenda, presentations and other conference materials can be found at www.uidaho.edu/AGEP2019.  Broader Impacts  The meeting provided a platform to share information priorities, policies, and procedures to AGEP stakeholders. Participants gained insights and understanding about diverse pathways in STEM and have valuable information about the NSF's strategic priorities, policies, and procedures to broaden participation. Additionally, tribal colleges, community colleges, research universities, professional master's programs, and 4-year public universities and other AGEP stakeholders discussed opportunities and challenges of model development from the management, research, and evaluative perspectives. Additionally, in partnership with NSF, the conference provided opportunities and conversations to better define and understand the evaluation and reporting requirements for current and future AGEP and other NSF projects and priorities.  Three presentations were developed and delivered based on the 2019 conference.  Building a Model to Serve Indigenous Graduate Students in STEM and Report from the Technical Sessions at the 2019 AGEP Research Forum were presented at the 2020 AGEP National Research Meeting. An NSF funded project to support STEM Opportunities for American Indian/ Alaska Native graduate students was presented at the Sixth Biennial Ethnicity, Race, and Indigenous Peoples Conference.   Overall, the 2019 AGEP National Research Meeting re-energized AGEP participants, fostered a sense of belonging, and built momentum for the continuous transformation of graduate education and the advancement of minoritized people into the STEM professoriate.

"9974181<br/>Mason-Gamer<br/> The process of speciation is usually characterized as a splitting, during which populations within a species diverge from one another, eventually accumulating enough differences to be classified as separate species. However, new species can also arise when two divergent lineages come together, or reticulate, creating a hybrid lineage. Such reticulation of distinct lineages appears to be far more common in plants than in animals. The most common mechanism of hybridization in plants, polyploidy, involves additive combinations of entire sets of genomes (of chromosomes) from two parents. The resulting polyploid hybrids therefore have more chromosomes than either parent. Polyploidy is rare in some groups of plants, but extremely common in many others. In the grass family Poaceae, for example, which includes the species examined in this research by Dr. Mason-Gamer at the University of Idaho, about 70% of all species appear to be polyploid. Furthermore, polyploidy is involved in the origin of many important crops in the Poaceae, including the wheats, oats, and sugarcane.<br/> Because it is so common in many groups of plants, polyploidy deserves increased study to clarify patterns of polyploid origin and diversification. The grass genus Elymus, a member of the wheat tribe Triticeae, serves as a useful system for the study of polyploidy. First, it is an extremely widespread and diverse group of plants, and so illustrates well the evolutionary potential of polyploid species. Second, the genomes of its presumed progenitors are well characterized, particularly for the North American taxa in the diploid genera Critesion and Pseudoroegneria; therefore, the genomes of Elymus are likely to have recognizable origins. Studies of nuclear and chloroplast DNA markers from the North American species of Elymus will further understanding of several questions. Do all North American species of Elymus have the same or similar combinations of genomes? The answers will help to establish the taxonomic and evolutionary boundaries of the genus. Have similar polyploid genome combinations arisen more than once? In other words, can a single species or genus have multiple origins? The idea that one species may have multiple origins adds yet another level of complexity to our views of how species originate, persist, and diversify. While the specific features of polyploidy in Elymus may not necessarily apply to all plants, understanding the processes that have shaped this complex genus will advance knowledge of plant evolution and diversity.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,200000.00,200000,4900,PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS,9974181,,Roberta J Mason-Gamer,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,robie@uic.edu,Roberta,Mason-Gamer,,James E.

"9612110  Geist  This project is an integrated field, petrological, and geochemical study of Volcan Ecuador, Isla Isabela, Galapagos.  The immediate objectives of this study are as follows:  1. Determine the eruptive and structural history of the volcano through field studies and K-Ar dating.  2.  Obtain a sufficiently complete suite of chemical data so that the liquid line of descent can be determined and the nature of the parental magmas constrained.  3.  Identify  any temporal trends in composition, through analysis of suites of samples whose ages are constrained by a combination of stratigraphy and K-Ar dating.  For this purpose, samples will be taken from stratigraphic  sections exposed in fault scarps and caldera walls.  Determine what, if any, effect has the apparent faulting on Ecuador had on magma composition?  Laboratory based work will include major element analyses, petrographic studies, electron microprobe analyses of mineral phases, Sr, Nd, Pb, and Hf isotopic analyses, and trace element analyses.  The results obtained will be used, along with thermodynamic models of magmas, to model magma generation and evolution.  These will be compared with the results of studies of other volcanoes in the Galapagos.  This in turn will be used to address the problem of how the Galapagos mantle plume interacts with lithosphere and asthenosphere at shallow levels in the mantle beneath the Galapagos.

"FAIRLEY <br/>0511061<br/><br/>The role of faults in subsurface transport of heat and fluids has implications in many socially and economically important areas, such as petroleum and geothermal reservoir engineering, CO2 sequestration, nuclear waste disposal, and ore deposition.  Although a large body of work suggests that thermal, hydrochemical, and pressure distributions in faults may be driven by seismic activity and thermal-convective instability, establishing definite relationships between these factors has proven difficult, largely due to inability to observe subsurface processes directly.  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that temperature and geochemical variability observed in fault-controlled springs are the result of a combination of seismic activity, thermal-convective instability, and environmental forcing (i.e., diurnal and seasonal atmospheric temperature changes).  To test this hypothesis, we are gathering temperature data at 15 minute intervals from 18 geothermal springs that are in direct hydraulic contact with the Borax Lake fault, an active normal fault in the Alvord Basin of southeast Oregon.  This temperature data will be analyzed using discrete Fourier analysis to establish the influence of periodic/quasi-periodic (i.e., environmental forcing) and seismic driving forces on spring temperatures.  Residual variability in the time-series data not related to environmental and seismic drivers will be examined for evidence of non-linear deterministic behavior (i.e., ""chaos"") that may arise from unstable convection or complex variations in the stress-field of the fault.  Apart from its scientific/technical merits, this research will further graduate education in the geosciences, and enhance educational opportunities for undergraduates from non-PhD granting institutions by providing internships and/or summer research projects.  <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,157921.00,157921,4900,Hydrologic Sciences,0511061,,Jerry Fairley,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,jfairley@uidaho.edu,Jerry,Fairley,,L.

"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>Economic development in remote rural regions is a challenge throughout the world, but in high latitude areas, remoteness is joined by early measurable effects of climate change to make this challenge even greater.  To learn how local communities are adapting to the early effects of climate change in their vicinity, this project will compare data on economic and social indicators and will conduct a survey of municipal planners in 71 municipalities above 65N in northwest Russia, Finland, Sweden, and Norway.  Data on climate change experiences and problems or opportunities resulting from these experiences will be compared to municipal adaptation strategies and plans as part of their economic and community development programs.  The climate change and adaptation data will be compared to economic and demographic measures and trends across the set of municipalities to understand how they vary in their approach to adaptation and how this compares to levels of development among the municipalities.  <br/><br/>Municipalities are expected to vary in their approach to development and adaptation, both across countries and by level of development.  It is also expected that climate change may bring advantages as well as problems to local areas and these will be important in the study.  Understanding how these effects of climate change are viewed by the local leaders and how they view both opportunities and problems can help other rural regions in lower latitudes understand and prepare for changes that may affect their economies and their development potential in similar or different ways.  <br/><br/>The project will build a comparative database for measuring economic growth, human and natural resource endowments, location characteristics, and local development efforts, and to model change in economic development as a function of these factors.  The research team expects climate change adaptation and local development strategies to focus on location advantages, traditional industries, and/or human and natural resource advantages, and that these strategies will be associated with the most positive economic growth measures.

"With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor Richard V. Williams of the University of Idaho.  This research will involve the study of molecules predicted by theoretical calculations to exhibit the elusive property of homoaromaticity.  Several previously prepared molecules were shown not to exhibit this property in solution (condensed phases) but it has now been shown that solvent polarity has a profound influence on the barrier to the Cope rearrangement (crucial in determining homoaromaticity) in selected systems (semibullvalenes and barbaralanes).  Matrix effects on the structure of the ground states of bisannelated semibullvalenes will be examined, the mechanism of the matrix effects will be elucidated and optimum systems will be prepared based on these studies.  If successful, these annelated semibullvalenes will allow the direct spectroscopic observation of (what is effectively) the transition state for a pericyclic chemical reaction.  <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research include the training of young scientists who will not only gain broad experience in the synthesis of sensitive molecules, but will also be exposed to a wide range of state-of-the-art techniques and to the synergy between experiment and theory.   A feature of this research is collaborations with groups around the world which will expose the students to interdisciplinary and collaborative research.  In addition, study of these molecules will greatly advance the understanding of the complex electronic interactions and will provide considerable insight into the nature of these reactions and into matrix effects.  Controlling the electronic interactions within a molecule, particularly through matrix effects, is of significant fundamental interest and importance and has the potential for applications in catalysis, sensing and materials properties (e.g., non-linear optical effects).  <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.049,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,379500.00,379500,4900,UNIMOLECULAR PROCESSES,0714761,,Richard V Williams,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,williams@uidaho.edu,Richard,Williams,tli@nsf.gov,Tingyu Li,7032924949,"['01000809DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01000910DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",07/10/2007,07/15/2007,06/30/2011,Semibullvalenes as Transition State Probes:  Homoaromaticity and Matrix Effects,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,V,"['JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY~2008~73~Ayub, K; Zhang, R; Robinson, SG; Twamley, B; Williams, RV; Mitchell, RH~10.1021/jo701945~451~456~~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=160072294#000252325200013~Suppressing the thermal metacyclophanediene to dihydropyrene isomerization: Synthesis and rearrangement of 8,16-dicyano[2.2]metacyclophane-1,9-diene and evidence supporting the proposed biradicaloid mechanism~Y~~~~~~', 'J.

"EAR-0617648<br/>CHILDERS<br/><br/>The toxicological effects of prolonged exposure to elevated levels of arsenic are apparent in populations worldwide. Arsenic is now widely recognized as a global environmental contaminant and dissemination of arsenic in soils, sediments, surface and ground waters has been repeatedly documented. Intensive efforts have been put forth to determine the controls, regulation and pathways affecting the distribution of arsenic in subsurface aquifers. Fewer investigations have been initiated regarding controls on arsenic mobility and transport in geothermal fluids. Because geothermal fluids are one of the primary means of surface water arsenic contamination, it is imperative to understand controls on arsenic speciation and mobility in geothermal environments. The proposed project is a first step towards understanding the biological controls on arsenic speciation and mobility in geothermal fluids of springs within the Alvord Basin, OR.<br/>The goal of the proposed project is to investigate the geochemical and biological processes effecting arsenic speciation of surface-expressed geothermal fluids. We propose to show that rapid oxidation of arsenite to arsenate is primarily due to microbial processes, and that over their observed range the pH, temperature and oxygenation status of the fluids has a minor impact on arsenite oxidation within springs in which arsenite oxidation is occurring. Furthermore, we will use molecular tools to determine if microbial populations within arsenite oxidizing zones of spring outflow channels are consistent from spring to spring when geochemical parameters of pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen are equivalent. Finally, we will enrich for and isolate thermophilic arsenite oxidizing microorganisms presiding in springs in which rapid arsenite oxidation is occurring. It is anticipated that these basic studies will set the groundwork for future research investigating the controls on arsenic speciation in surface geothermal waters, the biogeochemical cycling of arsenic in geothermal waters, and the metabolic mechanisms employed by microorganisms utilizing arsenic as an energy source.<br/>Intellectual Merit. The completion of the proposed studies will have an immediate impact on the earth science and life science disciplines. It is recognized that arsenic mobility in geothermal environments is partly controlled by temperature and the oxidation potential of fluids, yet the principles defining arsenic solubility in geothermal fluids have been elusive. Thus it is critical to understand the role of microorganisms in regulating arsenic solubility for accurate geochemical models to be developed. Furthermore, the recognition that microorganisms actively participate in arsenic oxidation-reduction reactions is relatively recent, thus there is a demand for further studies investigating the types of interactions occurring between microorganisms and arsenic compounds.<br/>Broader Impacts. One of the primary goals of the PI's program is to expose students in the Environmental Sciences and Geology programs to microbiology. The incorporation of field investigations into an established interdisciplinary field class in collaboration with faculty in the Geological Sciences is a direct means of achieving that goal. Furthermore, continued collaborations among the PI, co-PI and faculty within the PI's home department will provide the infrastructure necessary for the development of a strong interdisciplinary biogeosciences program.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,189522.00,189522,4900,Geobiology & Low-Temp Geochem,0617648,,Susan E Childers,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,childers@uidaho.edu,Susan,Childers,,Enriqueta Barrera,,,07/12/2006,07/15/2006,06/30/2009,Biological and Geochemical Influences on Arsenic Speciation in a Geothermal Environment,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Scott A Wood'],E,,

"Host specialization and population differentiation in parasitoids<br/>Pellmyr, N. Olof<br/>University of Idaho<br/><br/>Parasites are an integral part of many ecosystems and represent much of the earth's biodiversity.  Specialization to hosts has been implicated as a major factor in the immense diversification of parasitic groups, however, empirical work examining the link between specialization and diversification has been based mostly on phytophagous insects.  Next to phytophagous insects, parasitoids are the second most diverse parasitic group, and are also an ecologically and economically important trophic link in terrestrial ecosystems, because they feed on many phytophagous insect species.  Ongoing research on the interactions between yuccas, yucca moths, and their hymenopteran parasitoids has identified a parasitoid species amenable to testing the link between host specialization and diversification.  Specifically, this study will analyze parasitoid host use patterns at several geographic scales, and evaluate how host use influences parasitoid population structure.  Previous research on yucca moths has shown that specialization to plant species and microhabitat within a plant are important to moth diversification.  Results from the proposed research will determine if these same factors also influence differentiation in parasitoids.  One objective will test hypotheses about how host microhabitat influences the pattern of parasitoid host use at a very local scale. A second objective will evaluate parasitoid host use at a broader geographic scale, and test hypotheses on how community context influences host specificity.  A final objective will test how host specificity due to host microhabitat and community context influences the pattern of parasitoid population structure obtained from molecular markers.  The proposed research will incorporate the third trophic level into a well-known and well-studied plant-insect interaction that is commonly used in biology textbooks as an example of the importance of mutualisms and species interactions. Undergraduate students will be actively involved at every level of the proposed research to further their training and understanding of science by providing hands-on experience in both the field and laboratory setting. <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,230000.00,230000,4900,POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG,0321293,,N.

"This project is assessing the feasibility of using nano-wires made of non-conductive polymers to detect various ions in solution. The hypothesis is that resistivity of such polymer wires are affected by sorption of electrolytes from the water and that ions with different mobilities would alter the electrical conductivity of the polymer in different ways. The work involves three objectives: fabrication of aqueous nanowire sensors, electrical characterization of the nanowires, and development of nanowire electrical contacts and dual sensors based on nanowire concepts. The study will evaluate whether polymer-based nanowires are more versatile than modified metal or ceramic nanowires and more affordable to manufacture.

"<br/>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Hartzell at the University of Idaho to study proteins that are required for gliding movement of bacterial cells on surfaces.  The model bacterium used for these studies, Myxococcus xanthus, uses two unrelated types of motors simultaneously to propel itself. One motor uses a fiber to pull the cell while the other motor releases a material that pushes the cell.  Each motor system has a component for forward and reverse motion. Although recent studies have elucidated the two motor mechanisms, little is known about the process by which the two different motor systems are coordinated when the direction of movement switches. Dr. Hartzell and her students have identified proteins that appear to play a role in the motor switching pathway. They are using biochemical, genetic, and molecular approaches to investigate the mechanism by which the two motors are synchronized to generate thrust in the same direction and to reverse their orientation simultaneously. Initial work will focus on understanding the interactions between MglA, a small GTP-binding protein, and its partner, MasK, a tyrosine kinase protein. <br/>This project will support the scientific training of two graduate and several undergraduate students in biological systems. The lead investigator has actively encouraged young women and students of underrepresented groups to join her lab. The proteins that these students will study are related to proteins that are essential for growth and development of animal cells. Both Ras and MglA interact with other proteins, including tyrosine kinases, to regulate critical cellular processes. However, there are several fundamental differences between the highly conserved bacterial and human GTP-binding proteins and tyrosine kinases that only recently have been revealed. Hence these studies promise to provide important clues to the function and evolution of these essential proteins and the complex pathways they control. <br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,330000.00,330000,4900,Genetic Mechanisms,0242191,,Patricia L Hartzell,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,hartzell@uidaho.edu,Patricia,Hartzell,,Eve Ida Barak,,,07/01/2003,07/15/2003,06/30/2007,Role of a Small GTPase in Coordinating Two Motility Systems,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,L,"['Journal of Bacteriology~2004~186~Ruifeng Yang, Sarah Bartle, Rebecca Otto, Angela Stassinopoulos, Matthew Rogers, Lynda Plamann, and Patricia Hartzell1~~6168~~~~AglZ is a filament-forming coiled-coil protein required for adventurous gliding motility of Myxococcus xanthus.~N~~~~~~', 'GENETICS~2006~172~Youderian, P; Hartzell, PL~10.1534/genetics.105.05054~1397~1410~~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=149607963#000236668100004~Transposon insertions of magellan-4 that impair social gliding motility in Myxococcus xanthus~Y~~~~~~', 'SCIENCE~2007~315~Mignot, T; Shaevitz, JW; Hartzell, PL; Zusman, DR~10.1126/science.113722~853~856~~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=154303067#000244069000071~Evidence that focal adhesion complexes power bacterial gliding motility~Y~~~~~~']",
"This project is a field and laboratory based investigation of the Vanda dike swarm in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica. These dikes crosscut Cambro-Ordovician granitoid plutons produced during the Ross Orogeny, and mark the transition between the cessation of subduction and the onset of extensional magmatism. Many dying convergent plate margins convert to extensional magmatism, and the Dry Valleys provide a magnificent opportunity to examine the shallow roots of a plate that experienced this transition. Because of their exceptional exposure, bimodal felsic and mafic compositions, and complex field relations, the Vanda dikes have the potential to reveal insights into this important phase of Antarctic tectonic history. <br/>The broader impacts include collaboration between a primarily undergraduate and two research institutions, and support for undergraduate participation in an exciting, field-based research project.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.078,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,15616.00,15616,4900,ANT Earth Sciences,0635746,,Dennis J Geist,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,dgeist@uidaho.edu,Dennis,Geist,aisern@nsf.gov,Alexandra Isern,7032928500,['0100CYXXDB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],07/06/2007,07/15/2007,06/30/2009,Collaborative Research: The Transition from Subduction to Extensional Magmatism in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,J,"['Eos~2007~89~Buck, S, Geist, D, Garcia, M, Harpp, K, Parcheta, C, and Matulaitis, I~~V13C-2136~~~~Amphibole Content and Composition of the Vanda Dike Swarm: Dry Valleys, Southern Victoria Land, Antarctica~N~~~~~~', 'Eos~2008~89~Parcheta, C, Garcia, M, Harpp, K, Geist, D, Buck, S, and Matulaitis, I~~V13C-2135~~~~Structural Analysis of the Vanda Dike Swarm, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Southern Victoria Land, Antarctica~N~~~~~~']",
"This project continues the successful NSF Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at the<br/>University of Idaho (University of Idaho). The University of Idaho SFS program started in 2001. The University of Idaho has been a NSA Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE) since 1999. It was most recently recertified as a CAE in 2005. The University of Idaho Computer Science Department faculty played the lead role in both the CAE distinction and the SFS funding. <br/><br/>The University of Idaho SFS program is somewhat unique in its diversification of degree programs that include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Accounting with an emphasis on forensics. By grouping students from all three disciplines into the same labs and seminars the University of Idaho SFS program provides a diversity and synergy that enables participants to appreciate the multifaceted aspects of IA, including perspectives from software, hardware, and auditing. In the past three semesters placement success for internships and full-time job offers has been 100%, indicating a maturation and stabilization of the University of Idaho SFS program. Of the 21 institutions involved in the NSF SFS program, the University of Idaho ranks fourth in terms of productivity and number of security clearances obtained.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: University of Idaho SFS scholars have hands-on laboratory experiences with a variety of network configurations including reconfigurable attack-defend scenarios, real-time embedded systems, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Through these laboratories the IA scholars gain the knowledge and insights that enable them to design and implement more secure and survivable systems. Previous SFS funding to the University of Idaho has resulted in six journal articles, 10 Master's theses, and 20 conference papers. To date, 14 SFS scholars have coauthored professional publications.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The broader impact of providing IA training to students in the SFS program is fourfold. First, both large complex IT systems and smaller real-time control systems used in the digital society would be better managed by experienced IA graduates in the event of accidental or deliberate damage. This enables more stable and dependable infrastructures. Second, by better educating our upcoming IA professionals we move closer to a new generation of secure networks and computer systems. By giving them hands-on experience with today's IA tools we can increase the chance that they will develop tomorrow's security technologies. Third, by having a mixture of Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Accounting scholars participating in the SFS program, scholars learn to appreciate the interconnectedness of computer networking, computer devices, audit logging and audit trails. Fourth, this interdisciplinary nature aids in attracting women and minorities to the University of Idaho, an EPSCOR school. The University of Idaho SFS policy of aggressively recruiting students from underrepresented populations (specifically women and minorities) has paid off such that their representation within the SFS participant pool (26%) is more than twice the percentage observed in the department and college.<br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.076,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,824965.00,824965,4900,CYBERCORPS: SCHLAR FOR SER,0621348,,Paul W Oman,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,oman@cs.uidaho.edu,Paul,Oman,vpiotrow@nsf.gov,Victor Piotrowski,7032925141,['04000809DB NSF Education & Human Resource'],07/11/2006,07/15/2006,06/30/2012,Continuation of University of Idaho Scholarship for Service Program,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Carol S Taylor', 'Jim Alves-Foss']",W,"['Journal of Computer Networks~2007~51(1)~S.

"In this five-year project Idaho Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (ID-EPSCoR) seeks to advance understanding of feedbacks between social and ecological systems and ecosystem services in mid-sized cities in the face of climate change and urban growth.  The program, Managing Idaho?s Landscapes for Ecosystem Services (MILES), builds Idaho?s capacity to study complex social-ecological processes, especially those associated with water demand and valuation of ecosystem services.  This research characterizes patterns of urban growth and ecological change, identify social drivers of urban growth and ecological change, identify valuable ecosystem services, construct an integrated modeling framework, develop visualization and virtualization tools, and generate and disseminate knowledge of social-ecological systems.  The major participating institutions in this project are: University of Idaho, Boise State University and Idaho State University.  Faculty and students from the College of Southern Idaho, Northern Idaho College, Lewis-Clark State College, College of Western Idaho and Eastern Idaho Technical College will also be engaged in this project.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>Idaho?s urban areas are in a strong development phase and the border changes between Idaho?s mid-sized cities and undeveloped land are accelerating.  The development and expansion of urban population centers and its concomitant population growth are producing demographic and cultural shifts that are altering how ecosystem services are defined and valued.  These dynamics are occurring against a backdrop of climate change and resource-demand change.  This proposal seeks to advance understanding of feedbacks between social and ecological systems and ecosystem services in mid-sized cities in the face of climate change and urban growth.  MILES builds Idaho?s capacity to study complex social-ecological processes, especially those associated with water demand and valuation of ecosystem services.  This research will characterize patterns of urban growth and ecological change, identify social drivers of urban growth and ecological change, identify valuable ecosystem services, construct an integrated modeling framework, develop visualization and virtualization tools, and generate and disseminate knowledge of social-ecological systems.  Three study areas have been selected because of their different ecosystem services demands, water provisioning, and urban growth trajectories: Boise/Treasure Valley, Coeur d?Alene/Post Falls, and Pocatello/Idaho Falls.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>This project has the potential for transformative knowledge generation that reaches beyond the place-based study and is applicable to other semi-arid, mid-sized cities undergoing growth, both nationally and internationally.  New STEM and mentoring programs and workshops will specifically focus on recruiting females, Native Americans, Hispanics and other minorities, while K-12 activities will focus on underserved populations.  MILES Undergraduate Research Internships (MURI) will provide 300 undergraduate scholarships to engage Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) undergraduates in hands-on, paid summer and academic year research experiences.  The proposers will strive to have significant participation of URMs in the MURI activity.  The Bringing and Learning Communities program will leverage field-based MILES experiences at each of the study sites for cohorts of college faculty, 1st year undergraduates, high school STEM teachers, high school juniors and seniors, and Idaho Public TV journalists.  The activities are designed to foster broad stakeholder and public engagement.  Idaho EPSCoR has ambitious goals for recruitment and retention of women, underrepresented minority (URM) students and faculty and students from Idaho?s 100 existing STEM Pipeline K-12 programs and five PUIs.

Under the oversight of the Idaho EPSCoR Committee, the award advanced the State's Higher Education Research Strategic Research Plan, leveraging research and education strengths at University of Idaho [UI], Boise State University [BSU], and Idaho State University [ISU] in ecology, agricultural and natural resources, biological sciences, public policy, and other disciplines. It increased Idaho's human and physical resources for advancing academic research capacity; resulted in new knowledge about relationships between ecosystems, landscape change and associated socio-economic systems; established an infrastructure of science-based decision support for informing landscape management and policy; and educated diverse students to succeed in today's economy. Consequently, Idaho's scientific community is recognized as a national leader in natural-human systems research.  Intellectual Merit: Urban expansion often transforms landscapes and influences agricultural production, water resources, and amenity-based services that are already driving growth. This research determined 1) the patterns, magnitude and rate of change associated with mid-size city growth; 2) how societal and climate drivers influenced changing patterns and how communities responded to changes; and 3) expected future changes and key decisions that may alter them.  Dozens of professors, nearly 30 postdoctoral fellows, and approximately 150 graduate students at Idaho's educational institutions benefited from this award. Interdisciplinary teams comprising MILES developed new insights into ecosystem service valuation, analysis and vulnerability assessment. The impacts of disciplinary integration: we can better analyze complex social-ecological problems by linking social, biophysical, and other disciplines; early and frequent engagement between stakeholders and researchers; and sustained collaborations between Idaho scientists and the world's research community.  Transdisciplinary and synthesis research was featured in high-impact publications like Science and Nature. Research has yielded over 150 journal publications already. Fifty reflected significant cross-disciplinary perspectives, and many were the result of scientists from different universities working together. The 11 new early-career faculty recruited to Idaho because of this award were very influential and productive.  Broader Impacts: MILES research led to many products and improved ecosystem service management to meet community needs. Over 300 stakeholders engaged in the project. For example, MILES helped the City of Pocatello prioritize water quality improvement projects and informed river restoration planning decisions through the exploration of various scenarios. In Treasure Valley, empirical investigations into the complexity of water use and its social and legal vulnerabilities identified a lack of shared scientific understanding on key elements of water resource use. Thus, the Treasure Valley Water Atlas and a new water rights framework integrating a spatially distributed hydrologic model were developed. In cooperation with the Coeur d'Alene Tribe in northern Idaho, investigations of water quality issues revealed complex synergies by which sediment and nutrient pollution may exacerbate metal mobilization in the waters. Water quality modeling in the Coeur d'Alene basin is now integrated into visualization products for engaging stakeholders on management decisions.   The capacity for greater research activity following the award is partly coordinated through ISU's Center for Ecological Research and Education, the Human-Environment Systems group at BSU, and The Center for Resilient Communities and the Lake Social Ecological Systems lab at UI. Collaborations also leveraged shared cyberinfrastructure, strategies, and procedures for comparison across institutions and research sites, further increasing Idaho's capacity and competitiveness for social-ecological systems research and impacting research workflow, data sharing and efficiency. MILES data products are available to the public.  MILES helped prepare a highly-trained workforce for Idaho. Nearly 300 undergraduates received paid research experiences with structured training: 54% are female and 37% underrepresented minority students. Increased collaboration among Primarily Undergraduate Institution faculty and university faculty also resulted.  Thus far, 91 undergraduates trained in the program earned their degrees, preparing them for careers in government agencies and private entities involved in land and resource management. Such training can lead to new and better frameworks for addressing many environmental issues facing society.  Several hundred K-12 teachers gained knowledge of social and ecological science, as well as environmental citizenship, through Adventure Learning workshops. The Idaho Diversity Network expanded institutional collaboration, increasing opportunities for Idaho's Underrepresented Minority students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics programs.  Idaho's research teams received extensive press coverage for their innovative and impactful research. Idaho's citizens are increasingly aware of social-ecological issues and their role in maintaining or enhancing ecosystems. Idaho scientists also engaged in international efforts to understand and compare social-ecological dynamics related to water scarcity.  Summary: This $24 million RII award plus over $38 million in additional follow-on funding won from federal and state agencies significantly contributed to Idaho's faster growth rate in research competitiveness over the past five years, measured by total Higher Education Research Expenditures.

"In this EAGER proposal, the PI has proposed, as a supplementary educational activity to the Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state, and Precipitation at Summit (ICEAPS) atmospheric-science project (ARC- 0856773), to engage in a formal distance-learning activity with students in Idaho in which students would use off-the-shelf and relatively inexpensive hand-held devices to conduct experiments analogous to those researchers conduct in Greenland, as part of ICECAPS, with far more sophisticated equipment.<br/><br/>In discussions with the PI, it has been decided that this project will be recommended for funding as a pilot, both to see whether the technological capacity exists to carry out the kinds of instruction the PI envisions, but also to see whether the ICECAPS distance-learning project (Adventure Learning @ Greenland) can be made to dovetail with and enhance Science in Education Week, an activity involving U.S. students that is part of the Denmark, Greenland, U.S.-supported Joint Science Education Project (JSEP).",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.078,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,58392.00,58392,4900,ARCTIC RESEARCH AND EDUCATION,1240700,,Brant G Miller,,,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443082,bgmiller@uidaho.edu,Brant,Miller,,Peter West,,['0100CYXXDB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],06/06/2012,06/15/2012,02/28/2013,Adventure Learning @ Greenland,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Robert J Hougham'],G,," AL@GL 2012 was a pilot project with the purpose of engaging high school students in atmospheric research in the Arctic and in local environments to enhance climate literacy. Three fundamental concepts were explored: radiation, the greenhouse effect, and climate vs. weather. Over the course of the project, students conducted scientific inquiry associated with their location that aligned with the scientific principles and research of an atmospheric observatory at Summit Station, Greenland. Approximately 35 students participated in the hybrid learning environments as part of the project at multiple locations in Idaho, USA, and Greenland. In Greenland, Summit Station is located on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) [72&deg;N, 38&deg;W, 3200 m] and was the primary location of interest.  The AL@GL 2012 project provided a compelling opportunity to engage students in an inquiry-based curriculum alongside a cutting-edge geophysical research initiative at Summit: the Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state, and Precipitation at Summit (ICECAPS) project (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/arctic/observatories/summit/). ICECAPS measures parameters that are closely tied to those identified in student misconceptions. Thus, ICECAPS science and the AL approach combined to create a learning environment that was practical, rich, and engaging.  Intellectual Merit.  Students participating in AL@GL 2012 activities were given a pre/post survey that measured content knowledge, understanding of science inquiry and the nature of science, and perceptions of human ecological impact. Pre surveys were administered to students in Greenland and the US prior to AL@GL activities. Post surveys were administered immediately following AL@GL activities and prior to students departing for home.  The pre/post assessment of student content knowledge produced mixed results. Total scores across the multiple-choice items relating to understanding of science inquiry, the nature of science, and perceptions of human ecological impact remained essentially unchanged for students in Greenland and the US after participating in the program. However, short-answer responses indicated that studentsÆ understanding of key climate topics, including clouds, radiation, greenhouse effect, and weather and climate, all increased. Table 1 contains the percentage of students who demonstrated understanding of each of these topics during the pre-survey and post-survey. An increase in understanding is evident for students in Greenland and the US across all four topics. Overall, percentages were higher for students in Greenland than for students in the US.

"Fluid flows in nature vary intrinsically over space and time.  Simultaneously mapping the flow field within a three-dimensional (3D) volume will allow the full characterization of not only the flow field, but also the pressure field and any shear and normal forces within the fluid and at boundaries. This will have a transformative impact on our ability to characterize solute mixing, particle and solute transport, and aquatic organisms, ranging from microorganisms within porous media to fish moving in a river.  This project funds the acquisition of a Volumetric Velocimetry System (VVS) to support experimental research that will map flow fields in physical models of geoscience phenomena.  The VVS will provide researchers the capability to acquire volumetric realizations of flow structures using this minimally invasive tool.   Example applications of the system include model studies of breakout during surface lava flow which will improve prediction of when lava will arrive at specified location.   In a second application, the VVS will probe critical questions about and solute and sediment grain transport in streambeds.  Results from these studies will, for example, improve predictions of channel stability and be applied to the design of river restoration projects.  Lastly, volumetric descriptions of the experimental flow fields from this system will be powerful tools for the validation of complex computational models, which are becoming a common investigative tool even though in many circumstances models are not benchmarked with proper data. A web presence highlighting VVS projects will provide visualizations and links to available data. A partnership with a local middle-school teacher will facilitate visits of local students to the Center for Ecohydraulics Research at University of Idaho. <br/><br/>The acquisition of a Volumetric Velocimetry System (VVS) will enable researchers to overcome the crucial shared challenge faced by scientists and engineers who seek understanding of the fundamental nature of several types of fluid flows: the inability to acquire all three temporally and spatially resolved components of velocity data and their spatial and temporal derivatives, whose information will allow direct solution the Navier-Stokes equations retrieving information on the pressure and force distribution. Moreover, volumetric descriptions of the experimental flow fields from this system will be powerful tools for the validation of complex computational models, which are becoming a common investigative tool even though in many circumstances models are not benchmarked with proper data. Pursuing these research avenues will yield insights into geoscience phenomena, including entrainment in deep-sea hydrothermal systems and breakout during surface lava flows. In addition, coupling the VVS with the refractive index matching will probe critical questions about microbial colonization of pore interstices, turbulence dissipation at and within streambeds and its impact on organisms, and solute and sediment grain transport in streambeds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,241902.00,276822,4900,Instrumentation & Facilities,2043382,,Ralph S Budwig,"322 East Front Street, Suite 340",Boise,US,ID02,University of Idaho,ID,837027367,rbudwig@uidaho.edu,Ralph,Budwig,lastiz@nsf.gov,Luciana Astiz,7032924705,"['01002324DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",06/08/2021,06/15/2021,11/30/2023,Acquisition of a Volumetric Velocimetry System,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['Erika Rader', 'Elowyn Yager', 'Daniele Tonina', 'Eric L Mittelstaedt']",S,"['Measurement Science and Technology~2023~34~Hilliard, Brandon and Budwig, Ralph and Skifton, Richard S. and Durgesh, Vibhav and Reeder, William J. and Bhattarai, Bishal and Martin, Benjamin T. and Xing, Tao and Tonina, Daniele~https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6501/acfb2b~~~~~Measuring porous media velocity fields and grain bed architecture with a quantitative PLIF-based technique~~~10483665~10465314~OSTI~2023-09-29 00:03:48.36~']","  Acquisition of a Volumetric Velocimetry System   Fluid flows in nature vary intrinsically over space and time. In the present project we have acquired a measurement system that simultaneously maps the flow field within a three-dimensional (3D) volume, allowing the full characterization of not only the flow field, but also subsequent reconstruction of the pressure field and any shear and normal forces within the fluid and at boundaries. We anticipate a transformative impact on our ability to characterize solute mixing, particle and solute transport, and aquatic organisms, ranging from microorganisms within porous media to fish moving in a river. This project has funded the acquisition of a Volumetric Velocimetry System (VVS) to support experimental research that will map flow fields in physical models of geoscience phenomena. The VVS provides researchers the capability to acquire volumetric realizations of flow structures using this minimally invasive tool. Volumetric descriptions of the experimental flow fields from this system are powerful tools for the validation of complex computational models, which are becoming a common investigative tool, but must be benchmarked with proper data.   The VVS was purchased and commissioned during the project period and has been applied to two research projects. First, it was used to study surface-subsurface flow interactions in a physical model of a salmon redd at the University of Idaho (UI), Center for Ecohydraulics Research (CER). Female salmonids bury their eggs in streambed gravel by digging a pit where they lay their eggs, which they then cover with gravel from a second pit, forming a dune-like structure called a redd, which has coarse grains on the surface due to the winnowing away of fine material. The interaction between a redd and the stream flow induces surface water to enter the sediment, flow through the egg pockets, and then reemerge downstream of the redd crest. These downwelling and upwelling flows form the hyporheic exchange, which is vital for the embryos development because it regulates the egg pocket temperature regime and delivers oxygen-rich surface water to the embryos. Here, we experimentally investigate the effects of (1) redd surface roughness and (2) egg pocket presence on redd-induced hyporheic flows under different surface hydraulics. We use non-intrusive optical measurement techniques, including stereo particle image velocimetry (SPIV) and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF), in a large-scale flume by matching the refractive index of the transparent solid grains (made of fluorocarbon resin) and the fluid (water mixed with 15% Epsom salt). This allows us to see through the solid matrix of grains and map the flow fields above and within the salmon redd. The measurement results were used to assess the performance of a computation fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the surface and subsurface flows. The validated CFD model was then applied to a range of dunes sizes and flow conditions.   In the second project, also conducted at UI CER, we modeled stream flow over a vegetation stalk. We applied tomographic particle image velocimetry (TPIV) was to measure the three-dimensional free surface flow around a barely submerged vertical cylinder over a plane bed of coarse granular sediment in a full-scale flume experiment. Water surface elevation, the pressure field, and subsurface flow were reconstructed from the measured velocity field. The quantification of velocity and pressure fields over streambeds is important for predicting sediment mobility, benthic and hyporheic habitat qualities, and subsurface flow exchange.   Broader impact goals were addressed in three ways, (i) the development of a web presence for the VVS and VVS projects (https://vvs-fluids.org), (ii) hosting of visitors to CER, and (iii) and collaboration with a middle school science teacher. Finally, results from CER studies may, for example, be applied to the design of river restoration projects as well as to informing water release protocols for regulated rivers.

"Jean'ne M. Shreeve, Department of Chemistry, University of Idaho, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program to synthesize and study new ionic liquids containing perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl ether groups. Imidazolium, triazolium and tetrazolium cations will be treated with various strong alkylating agents to provide mono-, di- and poly-perfluoroalkylated ionic liquids. Polydentate centers or templates, including phosphazenes, triazines, macrocyclic amines, bipyridines and polymeric phosphazenes and azines will also be perfluoro- or polyfluoroalkylated to give new types of fluorinated ionic liquids. The fluorinated ionic liquids are expected to have higher densities, higher thermal stabilities, higher oxidation resistance and controlled viscosities than current non-fluorinated ionic liquids.<br/><br/>Ionic liquids, or molten salts, are attractive alternatives to volatile organic compounds as solvents. The desirable properties of ionic liquids include a wide useful temperature range, low vapor pressure, thermal and chemical stability with tunable viscosity and density. They are also being explored as low/high temperature fluids, lubricants in extreme environments and as  electrolytes in fuel cells. This project will develop a new class of fluorinated ionic liquids. Undergraduate, graduate student and postdoctoral researchers will learn valuable technical skills and gain experience in experimental design and application of new materials to real world needs.

"Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused two serious epidemics in humans (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) and the current COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV2). There is evidence suggesting that although these CoVs originated from bats, other mammals could have been intermediate hosts that transmitted the virus to humans. Research supported by this award will help to identify animal populations that are likely susceptible to the current pandemic CoV (SARS-CoV2) and could potentially act as viral reservoirs and initiate new disease outbreaks. Determining the animal receptors that enable SARS-CoV2 cell entry will benefit both human and animal health by directing future studies of CoV tropism. This knowledge will also focus surveillance efforts to species most likely involved in zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV2 and other CoVs. This proposal will train undergraduate research students in computational and laboratory skills during the proposed project.  Results from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, posted to shared data repositories, and also shared through social media.<br/><br/>Research supported by this award will employ computational modeling and empirical laboratory research to identify animal angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptors that confer susceptibility to SARS-CoV2. Researchers will test the hypothesis that certain amino acid residues in animal ACE2 are essential for coronavirus (CoV) spike protein interaction and cell entry. A computational pipeline will be developed to model and simulate the docking of the SARS-CoV2 receptor binding domain to the ACE2 cell receptor from hundreds of divergent animal species. We will also empirically test the capacity of SARS-CoV2 spike protein to utilize ACE2 through heterologous expressions systems and in vitro cell culture studies. The research has the potential to identify a wide spectrum of animal species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV2. This will aid in the understanding of the relationship between ACE2 genotype and SARS-CoV2 cell entry and allow the prediction of ACE2 residues that are critical for determining CoV susceptibility.

Given the large numbers of humans that have been infected with SARS-CoV2, it has emerged that humans can transmit the virus to certain species of domesticated and peri-domesticated animals. This process is referred to as reverse zoonosis. Our interdisciplinary group included scientists with expertise in bioinformatics, biophysics, and virology and a team of diverse undergraduate students that were mentored and trained in all aspects of the research project. The team began by collating a comprehensive database of all currently known animal genes for the cell surface receptor ACE2. This protein acts as the primary receptor that enables SARS-CoV2 cell entry by interacting with the viral spike (S) protein. Without this receptor a cell is practically immune to viral infection. We have now curated a database of 678 ACE2 gene sequences and have determined their divergence from human ACE2. Amino acid diversity among animal ACE2 gene sequences is high, although less so for residues directly interacting with the S protein, with 24% identity across all animals. With the curated list we have employed computational modeling to predict whether animal ACE2 proteins can interact with the S protein of SARS-CoV2. This has resulted in the creation of 678 molecular scale models of the interactions that occur between these proteins. To validate these computational predictions, we used a non-replicating virus that enters cells using the SARS-CoV S protein to measure successful use of different animal ACE2 proteins. Focusing on ACE2 from rodent species that are important for spreading human diseases, we have tested their capacity to enable cell entry of SARS-CoV2. This approach has identified rodent species that are predicted to be susceptible to SARS-CoV2 with the potential of harboring the disease as an animal reservoir. All the data for this project is to be deposited on a user-friendly website that can be accessed to identify animal species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV2, their geographical locations, ACE2 sequences, and 3D models of the interactions between ACE2 and S protein. This will provide a valuable resource for scientists studying SARS-CoV2 and an educational resource for the public.          Last Modified: 09/13/2021       Submitted by: Paul A Rowley"
"9705661  Wood  Knowledge of the behavior of the rare earth elements (REE) in high temperature water solutions is required in the following areas: 1) geochronology (i.e., rock dating); 2) REE ore deposit geology; and 3) remediation and safe storage of nuclear waste . Unfortunately, there is a lack of the relevant data required for a better understanding od REE geochemistry. It is expected that the REE will form a dissolved complex with the chloride ion in many natural solutions, and it is known that REE phosphate phases (monazite, xenotime, rhabdophane) are common REE minerals. Thus, the objectives of this proposal are to: 1) determine the solubility of monazite/xenotime in hydrothermal solutions up to 350(C; 2) determine the stoichiometries and stabilities of REE chloride complexes up to 350(C; and 3) apply our experimental data to problems related to the mobility of REE during water-rock interaction. The data obtained in this study will resolve discrepant theoretical estimates in the literature, provide one of the first experimentally derived sets of thermodynamic data for REE complexes at elevated temperatures, permit quantitative modeling of the role of REE chloride complexes in REE mobility, and serve as a basis for improved theoretical predictions of stability constants for other REE complexes for use until additional experimental data become available. During the course of this project, one graduate and one undergraduate student will be trained in hydrothermal experimental techniques, a number of modern analytical methods, and various aspects of aqueous geochemistry relevant to studies in economic geology and environmental geochemistry.

"This workshop addresses a pressing and fundamental topic in plant hydraulics, how we accurately measure hydraulic vulnerability to embolism. The field of plant hydraulics has become increasingly invoked to link plant functioning with changes in climate and plant hydraulics data is critical for improving process-based models of plant and ecosystem responses to climate change. The current discrepancies are not trivial and have hindered plant hydraulics through declined manuscripts, unsubmitted or unfunded grant proposals, and an avoidance of groundbreaking research that utilizes plant hydraulic measurements. Most importantly, this workshop will allow the interpretation of future studies to not be mired in debate about methodology but instead be considered for their scientific value to the discipline. In addition to advancing scientific methodology, this workshop will train up to 5 postdoctoral researchers and 8 students (graduate and undergraduate) in the best practices for five frequently used methods to measure plant hydraulics thus improving future scientific outputs that involve plant hydraulic measurements. Additionally, this workshop will allow for collaboration of researchers who come from many diverse backgrounds, including at least 9 women and individuals from five different countries. <br/><br/>Plant hydraulics, the study of how plants move and manage water, has become an invaluable realm of science that has been invoked to address critical questions across spatial scales and biological disciplines. Particularly, advances in methodologies that allow scientists to efficiently derive hydraulic vulnerability curves in the laboratory have greatly advanced our understanding of plant functioning. Despite these methodological advances, several recent publications (e.g. Choat et al. 2010, Cochard et al. 2013, Jansen et al. 2015) have suggested that some of the most commonly used measurement methods give varying results, and thus the discipline is currently challenged with reconciling these differences. Due to these conflicting reports about methodologies, the scientific community is at an opportunistic moment to advance past these challenges by addressing all current methodologies in a focused and inclusive study. This workshop will use five methods to develop vulnerability curves on species that span wood anatomy and include species that have previously shown varying results depending on the method used. This methodology will allow for resolution of the influence of anatomical differences on discrepancies across the four methods requiring excised plant material and link these results to imaging of live plants using high-resolution computed tomography (HRC.

"PI Barrie D. Robison <br/>Proposal # IOS-0808551<br/>Behavioral adaptation to captivity in the zebrafish, Danio rerio.<br/><br/>Captive breeding programs are often used as a conservation tool. Unfortunately, adaptation to the captive environment (domestication) can produce dramatic behavioral changes that make captive animals unsuitable for release into the wild. Understanding the processes that produce the tame behavior typical of domesticated populations helps the development of informed conservation decisions. Wild and domestic zebrafish will be used to examine the relationship between stress and the tame behavioral type produced by domestication. Studies will integrate behavioral and hormonal assays with studies of genetics. Wild populations of zebrafish are expected to show higher levels of stress hormones in the laboratory relative to domestic populations, as well as higher responses to stressful activities such as handling by humans. This research will build understanding of how and why behavior changes during domestication, and set the stage for future studies on the genetic basis of these changes. Broader impacts will include research training opportunities that will enhance educational experiences by integrating studies of behavior, endocrinology, and genetics.

" Late Cenozoic deformation is broadly distributed across the North American plate margin of the conterminous western United States and stretches from the San Andreas fault system eastward across the Mojave Desert and into the Basin and Range. The eastern California shear zone and Walker Lane of the western Great Basin form an active belt of structures accommodating about 25% of the relative motion between North America and the Pacific plate.<br/>From the Mojave Desert, the displacement is carried north, east of the southern Sierra Nevada, in a narrow zone of deformation bound on the west and east by the Owens Valley and Furnace Creek fault systems. North from the latitude of the central Sierra Nevada, the zone of deformation broadens to include the Walker Lane and central Nevada seismic belt in the northwestern Great Basin. The Sierra Nevada behaves as a coherent tectonic block with a northwest-directed motion of 10-14 mm/yr and forms the western boundary of the zone of distributed deformation in the Great Basin. A complex pattern of active structures underlies west-central Nevada where displacement is transferred from the eastern California shear zone to the Walker Lane and the central Nevada seismic belt. Integrated geologic, seismological, and GPS geodetic results indicate that the central Walker Lane (CWL) serves as an displacement transfer system linking stepped northwest-trending transcurrent faults. The displacement transfer system evolved over a period of ~13 Ma and carried at least 50 km right-lateral motion from the Furnace Creek fault system of eastern California to the right-lateral faults of the CWL. Ancient displacement transfer was accompanied by exhumation of mid-crustal rocks in the extensional stepover between transcurrent structures and was accompanied by vertical axis rotation and tilt of both upper- and lower-plate assemblages. The transfer system is still active and underlies a region 50 by 120 km immediately northwest of the ancient structures. Based on existing work, the comparison of a geodetically determined velocity field for the CWL is not easily reconciled with the current understanding of fault displacements in the region and points out the difficulty in comparing geodetic and geologic displacement fields. Furthermore, the continued activity of the displacement transfer system since inception at ~13 Ma offers presents the opportunity to assess ancient and active rates of deformation using geologic and geodetic techniques.<br/>The PI's propose an integrated geodetic and geologic investigation of the central Walker Lane to address two questions: (1) What is the three-dimensional geometry and displacement history of extensional transfer developed within a transcurrent fault system stepover?, and (2) Are displacement rate and kinematic estimates comparable between geodetic, seismological, and geologic investigation of ancient and active structures within the transfer system? The central Walker Lane is ideally suited for this study for several reasons: (1) the region is seismically active and well defined earthquake focal mechanisms exist for the displacement transfer fault system, (2) the faults are well exposed and have produced preliminary fault-slip estimates of deformation kinematics, (3) a complex present-day displacement field with ~10 mm/yr of differential slip is recorded by a GPS geodetic network, (4) the geologic evolution of the displacement transfer system is preserved in the exhumation history of well-exposed extensional turtleback structures, (5) synorogenic volcanic and sedimentary rocks in the upper-plate assemblage of the extensional complex record a history of progressive tilt associated with fault displacement, (6) regionally extensive domains of differential tilt and vertical axis rotation associated with displacement transfer are recognized in preliminary paleomagnetic investigation, and (7) regional geologic compilation of the region is mature and provides excellent control for displacement-history reconstruction. These elements will allow characterization of the kinematics of displacement transfer and offer the opportunity to directly compare deformation kinematics and rates over geologic and geodetic time intervals. The PI's will address the tasks listed above with an integrated study utilizing detailed geologic mapping, structural analysis, GPS geodesy, paleomagnetic analysis, geochronology, and thermobarometric investigation. The research team (Oldow, Geissman, McClelland, McIntosh, and Selverstone) have the expertise to address the various research topics and two of the researchers (Oldow and Geissman) have substantial experience working in the area. By building on previous studies, this integrated investigation will establish the areal limits of the transtensional fault system, document variable geometric relations between major and secondary fault systems, define the kinematic history of fault block motion, and develop first-order estimates of recent and ancient displacement. <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,166127.00,180611,4900,Tectonics,0208219,,John S Oldow,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,oldow@utdallas.edu,John,Oldow,,David Fountain,,,06/25/2002,06/15/2002,05/31/2006,"Collaborative Research:  Deformation Rates and Kinematics of Ancient and Active Displacement Transfer, Central Walker Lane, Western Great Basin",Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['William McClelland'],S,,

"This project will study the question of what governs the diversity of species using the Galapagos Islands, where factors influencing diversity range in their complexity. The islands of the Galapagos vary in age from young (less than 50,000 years old) to old (more than 4 million years old). This range in age can be used to study how biological diversity is shaped when communities are simple with few interacting species (on young islands), and when communities are more complex and characterized by numerous biological interactions (on older islands). This project will measure the rate at which new species are formed and diversity accumulates across a group of approximately 80 species of land snails forming the Galapagos's largest proliferation of species diversity. A combination of field and laboratory studies will be used to understand how the rate of evolution is influenced by the complexity of natural selection. A course for undergraduate students at the University of Idaho will introduce students to biodiversity patterns and guide them through the underlying evolutionary core principles generating these patterns using a series of field research excursions in the Pacific Northwest that is analogous to the Galapagos research expeditions. Students will also follow Galapagos research via Adventure Learning capsules (videos and integrated teaching material) which will guide and inspire them in the development of their own local research projects. Outreach activities also include developing a bilingual English-Spanish guidebook of Galapagos terrestrial snails, presentations and workshops for Galapagos park rangers, staff scientists, and guides, and disseminating research results in scientific publications, textbooks, magazines and the popular press.<br/><br/>Islands are living laboratories where evolutionary change is clear, tangible, and can be directly observed. On Galapagos, the number of selection pressures increases from young to old islands as species assemble in more diverse and complex communities. Although substantial research efforts have been devoted to quantify selection in simple environments, there is a need to characterize the effects and interactions of multiple selection pressures in complex natural biological systems, and the proposed work will fill this gap. The project will characterize variation in morphological and physiological traits of snails and quantify variation in multiple environmental factors for the approximately 80 Galapagos endemic land snail species of the genus Naesiotus and their mainland relatives. Species-level phylogenetic history of the lineage will be reconstructed to determine the number of independent colonization events that led to the diversity of Galapagos Naesiotus snails, and put the phenotype-environment association analyses in a phylogenetically-informed framework. The data will then be used to address hypotheses related to the effects of multiple selection pressures (i.e., increased complexity) on the rate of phenotypic change and adaptation in this lineage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,1093880.00,1117829,4900,PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS,1751157,,Christine E Parent,"875 Perimeter Dr. MS 3051, Unive",Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443051,ceparent@uidaho.edu,Christine,Parent,mfujita@nsf.gov,Matthew Fujita,7032927814,"['01002223DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002122DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001819DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002021DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002021DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",04/22/2018,05/15/2018,04/30/2025,CAREER:   Islands as Models to Study Effects of Multidimensional Selection,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,E,"['Journal of Molluscan Studies~2020~86~Hirano, Takahiro and Recla, Nicole K and Oiler, Ian M and Phillips, John G and Parent, Christine E~https://doi.org/10.1093/mollus/eyaa014~~~~~Use of tree resin as a food source by Galápagos land snails: a novel hypothesis for the fossilization of snails in amber~~263 to 266~10211694~10211694~OSTI~2021-04-26 10:52:26.720~', 'Journal of Heredity~2020~111~Gillespie, Rosemary G and Bennett, Gordon M and De Meester, Luc and Feder, Jeffrey L and Fleischer, Robert C and Harmon, Luke J and Hendry, Andrew P and Knope, Matthew L and Mallet, James and Martin, Christopher and Parent, Christine E and Patton, Austin~https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esz064~~~~~Comparing Adaptive Radiations Across Space, Time, and Taxa~~1 to 20~10147386~10147386~OSTI~2021-04-26 10:52:26.756~', 'Journal of Heredity~2019~111~Phillips, John G and Linscott, T Mason and Rankin, Andrew M and Kraemer, Andrew C and Shoobs, Nathaniel F and Parent, Christine E and Gillespie, Rosemary~10.1093/jhered/esz068~~~~~Archipelago-Wide Patterns of Colonization and Speciation Among an Endemic Radiation of Galápagos Land Snails~~92 to 102~10147389~10147389~OSTI~2021-04-26 10:52:26.776~', 'Microbiology Resource Announcements~2019~8~Linscott, T.

"Gravity was the first force mathematically described by scientists as an explanation for the motion of the moon, planets, and stars. Hundreds of years later, gravity is still considered to be the most poorly understood force. It cannot be consistently described across different theories in physics, and even its strength is poorly known. The Newtonian constant of gravitation, which quantifies the strength of gravity, is perhaps the most poorly measured fundamental property of the universe. This project seeks to greatly improve our knowledge of this constant with the most significant change in technique since the experiments of Henry Cavendish in 1798, who used a torsion balance for his measurements. The measurement funded by this award may be of value across many areas of physics and astronomy, and the new experimental tools being developed may lead to new instruments for measuring extremely small forces and accelerations for use in studying the earth and for inertial navigation. Further, the attention to detail required in these experiments makes them an exceptional training ground for tomorrow's STEM workers.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a new system for measuring the Newtonian constant of gravitation G, and to make a measurement of G to unprecedented accuracy (10 parts per million or better). The approach leverages a recently-developed optomechanical system: a silica microsphere suspended in a magneto-gravitational trap under ultra-high vacuum. The mechanical oscillation of the microsphere will be used in the time-of-swing method to determine G from the change in oscillation frequency when field masses are brought near the trapped particle. The system has multiple features that make it nearly ideal for precision measurements, including an oscillation frequency that can be made less than 1 Hz, isolation from the surrounding environment, and other degrees of freedom to act as a built-in probe to correct for drifts. The proposed measurement strategy was chosen for its transparency to the scientific community. First, the simplicity of the system makes it simple to understand and analyze. Second, most of the data will be contained in sequences of images which are recorded; there are almost no hidden feedback loops or other difficulties in reanalyzing components. To ensure confidence in the new measurement, all data and analysis code will be stored and made freely available to other researchers in their entirety.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.049,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,118517.00,112739,4900,"AMO Experiment/Atomic, Molecul",2227079,,Zachariah B Etienne,875 PERIMETER DRIVE MS 3020,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,zetienne@uidaho.edu,Zachariah,Etienne,pmarrone@nsf.gov,Pedro Marronetti,7032927372,['01002021DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],05/03/2022,05/15/2022,05/31/2025,Collaborative Research: Measuring G with a Magneto-Gravitational Trap,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,B,"['Review of Scientific Instruments~2024~95~Werneck, L R and Jessup, C and Brandenberger, A and Knowles, T and Lewandowski, C W and Nolan, M and Sible, K and Etienne, Z B and D’Urso, B~https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0206405~~~~~Cross-correlation image analysis for real-time single particle tracking~N~~10528732~10528732~OSTI~2024-08-29 19:08:48.816~']",
"Mathematics coaching is a research-based method to improve teacher quality, yet there is little research on teaching and coaching mathematics in rural contexts. In addition, mathematics coaches in rural contexts frequently work in isolation with little access to professional learning opportunities to support their coaching practice. This project will create a fully online video-based model for mathematics teacher professional development focused on supporting mathematics coaches in rural contexts, building on the investigators' previous work focused on online professional learning opportunities for mathematics teachers in rural contexts.  Results from the previous project focused on rural teachers and their coaches show that the professional development model increased connections between what teachers notice about student thinking and broader principles of teaching and learning, that teachers were able to enact stronger levels of ambitious mathematics instruction, and that teachers who received coaching showed a stronger focus on math content and instructional practice. This extension of the model to coaches includes an online content-focused coaching course, cycles of one-on-one video-based coaching, and an online video club to analyze coaching practice.  The video clubs will be structured as a graduated model that will begin with facilitation by mentor coaches and move into coach participants facilitating their own sessions.<br/><br/>Three cohorts of 12 coach participants will be recruited, with one cohort launching each year.  In the first year, coaches will participate in four 2-hour synchronous content-focused course meetings, two coaching cycles with a mentor coach, and four video club meetings. In the second year, cohorts will conduct and facilitate four video club meetings.  Research on impact follows a design-based model, with iterative cycles of design and revision of the online model. An ongoing analysis of 15-20% of the data collected each year will be used to inform revisions to the model from year to year, with fuller data analysis ongoing throughout the project. Participating coaches will be engaged in a noticing interview and surveys to assess changes in their perceptions and practices as coaches.  Each coach participant will record one coaching interaction as data to assess changes in coaching practices. Patterns of participation and artifacts from the online course will be analyzed.  Coaching cycle meetings and video club meetings will be recorded and transcribed.  The Learning to Notice framework will be used as an analytical lens for describing changes in coaching practice.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

"Biologists have been conducting surveys aimed at discovering and describing species for centuries. However, it is not known how many species are on the Earth, because discovering species on a one-by-one basis is time consuming and expensive. This lack of knowledge is an impediment to conservation aims and other goals important to society. To address this need, the researchers have developed an approach to identifying groups of populations that are likely to consist of several independent species. Because this approach is based on existing ecological and genetic data, the technique will become more refined as additional data are collected. The proposed research will develop and test this approach using data from an ecosystem in the Pacific Northwest that supports much biodiversity, and where several cryptic species have recently been discovered.<br/><br/>The proposed research will develop a predictive framework for the discovery of cryptic biodiversity that can be applied to all members of an ecosystem. In this two-phase framework, researchers will (i) gather environmental, taxonomic, functional, and genetic data from a reference set of taxa native a model ecosystem and identify which of these species contain cryptic diversity, (ii) conduct statistical analyses to identify habitat features shared by the taxa that harbor cryptic diversity, (iii) collect and analyze environmental data for a second set of species to make predictions about which of these species contain cryptic diversity, and (iv) test these predictions via collecting genetic data for the second set of taxa. The temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest of North America will serve as the model system. The disjunction of conspecific populations or putative sister-species pairs between Pacific coastal and interior Rocky Mountain segments presents clear hypotheses regarding potential cryptic diversity: either pre-Pleistocene vicariance, which predicts high cryptic diversity, or post- Pleistocene dispersal where which predicts a lack of cryptic diversity. These predictions will be tested by collection of genomic scale data for 24 endemic disjunct plants and animals, and application of Approximate Bayesian Computation to assess support for each hypothesis. This set of taxa will be then used as a training-set for classifying cryptically diverse species from their occurrence data and climatic variables associated with each. Classical multivariate approaches, such as Discriminant Function Analysis, as well as newer decision-tree approaches (such as RandomForest) will be assessed.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,622609.00,622609,4900,Biodiversity: Discov &Analysis,1457726,,Jack M Sullivan,,Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443051,jacks@uidaho.edu,Jack,Sullivan,kdittmar@nsf.gov,Katharina Dittmar,7032927799,"['01001516DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001617DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",03/23/2015,05/15/2015,10/31/2020,Collaborative Research: A Comparative Phylogeographic Approach to Predicting Cryptic Diversity - The Inland Temperate Rainforest as a Model System,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['David C Tank'],M,"['Proceedings of the Royal Society B~2016~283~Anahi Espindola, Megan Ruffley, Megan L.

The broadest significance of this body of work lies in building the comparative phylogeographic framework for predicting the presence/absence of cryptic diversity (i.e., previously unknown species that are closely related to known species) in particular, and patterns of biodiversity in general. For example, we have developed a predictive framework that allows biodiversity managers to predict the conservation status of species that have not been studied to the degree necessary to make an assessment.  Project personnel from both OSU and UI have collected hundreds of specimens relevant to the project. In addition to the main objectives, we have provided specimen identification of thousands of terrestrial gastropods from several hundred localities in the inland rainforest. These were collected by Idaho Fish and Game Biologists with no expertise in gastropod taxonomy and we continue to build collaborations with agency and museum-based biologists.  Several graduate students (4) and undergraduates (8) and a postdoctoral fellow (a female Argentinian) received research training. Two female grad students have completed thei PhD programs and with two others to follow soon.  The postdoc (Dr. Anahi Espindola) is now an Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland.

"Movement through their environments is a fundamental characteristic of most animals, (e.g., running, swimming, flying) and the mechanics of how animals perform this task have direct implications for evolutionary success because locomotion is involved with defense, finding mates, and foraging for food in efficient ways. For centuries, biomechanics research has provided a foundation for developing and testing hypotheses ranging from general governing principles of terrestrial locomotion to specific relationships between form and function of limbs and muscles. However, the vast majority of these studies have been conducted in laboratories on treadmills and tracks that bear little resemblance to the environments in which animals actually live. To truly understand the relationship between an animal's muscular and skeletal anatomy and locomotor performance, it is necessary to understand the mechanical demands of the tasks performed in the animal's natural environment. Understanding these relationships in natural habitats remains an important challenge. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the relationships between anatomy and locomotor performance through a series of experiments aimed at understanding in detail how different muscles contribute to movement tasks. Experiments will reveal how specific features of muscles and skeletons impact the function of particular muscles during locomotion in mechanically challenging natural environments. The outcomes of this research will advance knowledge about the functional roles of individual muscles, a topic that is rare in comparative biomechanics studies, and lay the groundwork for a better understanding of how mechanical energy is transferred through complex musculoskeletal systems. Application of this knowledge can lead to improvements in the design of autonomous robots, lower limb prosthetics, and other human locomotor enhancement devices.<br/><br/>The purpose of this research is to elucidate the relationships between musculoskeletal morphology and bipedal hopping dynamics in desert environments using desert kangaroo rats (D. deserti) as an animal model. It is generally believed that bipedal hopping has evolved because it provides a locomotor performance advantage (e.g., faster top speed, higher endurance, acceleration capacity) related to exaggerated hind limb morphology; however a specific advantage has not been identified for all hopping species. To achieve the proposed objectives, this study will incorporate analyses of habitat use in the field, gait dynamics in the lab, in-vivo muscle dynamics and detailed computer modeling and simulations. This will be the first study to combine all of these methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between musculoskeletal morphology and performance. This powerful, integrated approach will be used to pursue two specific research objectives: 1) Quantify the mechanical demands of bipedal hopping on substrates and terrain utilized by D. deserti in their natural environment and, 2) Elucidate the relationship between musculoskeletal morphology and habitat use. The outcomes of the proposed research will establish direct links between locomotor performance under natural conditions and musculoskeletal morphology and muscle function in a way that has not been previously possible. An enhanced understanding of how and why animals hop will advance the fields of evolutionary biology, comparative anatomy, and biomechanics, and lead to improvements in the design of autonomous robots, lower limb prosthetics, and other locomotor enhancement devices. This proposal supports an Educational Plan to develop a field course to provide an opportunity for students to integrate what they have learned about ecology and evolution through research-driven, field-based analyses of habitat use, functional morphology, and behavior. Data for behavior and habitat use from multiple years of this course will provide a broader context for interpreting morphological and biomechanical results.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,1110980.00,1114104,4900,Physiol Mechs & Biomechanics,1553550,,Craig McGowan,875 Perimeter Drive,Moscow,US,"ID""",University of Idaho,ID,838443051,cmcgowan@usc.edu,Craig,McGowan,kdickson@nsf.gov,Kathryn Dickson,7032927380,"['01001617DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001718DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001819DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01001920DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01002021DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",04/12/2016,05/15/2016,06/30/2021,CAREER: Establishing Links between Musculoskeletal Morphology and the Biomechanics of Bipedal Hopping in Desert Environments,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,,"['Journal of Experimental Biology~2018~~Craig McGowan and Clint Collins~~~~~~REVIEW: Why Do Mammals Hop?

"9320258  George  This is a pilot study to develop an on-line issue oriented  bibliographic database on ethics, technology and the environment.   The pilot phase will allow the investigators to (1) test the  hypothetical database form on at least three software products and  test the utility of formal options by discussing them with  potential users; (2) interview potential users (news reporters,  scholars, scientists, and secondary and university educators) to  determine what questions they will want answered and to establish  criteria for inclusion of material in database; (3) identify issue  areas and broaden database coverage to give capacity for including  all or almost all Northwest environmental issues; and (4) identify,  for software tests, a small number of summary review publications  on particular environmental issues from many different disciplines;  begin development of thesaurus and index of ordinary language and  technical terms from these. The goal is to develop a user friendly  database for people who want to make sound social judgments about  environmental issues in the Northwest.  The database should be  useful to humanities teachers and scholars, students and teachers  and the media, by giving them access to not only what other  commentators are saying but also to reviews and other summaries  about scientific aspects of these issues.  It will be useful to  scientists as well as others making social comment on science by  giving them better access to ethical perspectives and ethical  scholarship.  As information comes increasingly over computerized  networks, the development of user-friendly sources and resources  must have high priority.  This pilot provides a test of ways to  develop these sources, as well as a test of a unique resources for  U.S. citizens and scholars interested in important issues of  science and environmental policy.  ***",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.075,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,24996.00,24996,4900,Ethics & Values of SET,9320258,,Kathryn P George,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,environwest@uidado.edu                  kpgeorge@uidaho.edu,Kathryn,George,,Rachelle D.

"<br/>It is now clear that females in many animal species do not mate randomly.  The behavior of females before mating suggests a sampling process in which the value of potential mates is assessed.  Although we now know that female mate choice exists, we do not know what benefits a female gains from choice, or what specific behavioral rules she uses to make choice.  The goal of this research is to evaluate evolutionary models that offer answers to these questions.  To evaluate the models, it is necessary to measure the energy cost of mate sampling and the effects of choice on offspring quality, and to record how the experiences of females during sampling guide their choice behavior.<br/><br/>This research will take advantage of a well-developed study site (the National Bison Range in northwestern Montana) where individually marked pronghorn may be studied at close range.  Each year, most pronghorn females sample potential mates over a two-week period, and then mate once.  The energy cost of sampling will be measured using detailed records of female movements during rut, reconstructed from 10-minute interval Global Positioning System locations. Sire effects on offspring performance will be measured by recording prenatal and postnatal growth rates of fawns, as well as size-adjusted body mass and first winter survival. Sire identity will be verified genetically. Information to test hypotheses about the mate sampling method will be obtained by recording the complete sequences of female visits to males and whether, at each visit, the female has had the opportunity to see the male perform vigorously. <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,0.00,376082,4900,PHYSIOLOG & STRUCTURAL SYS,0097115,,Rolf L Ingermann,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,Jbyers@uidaho.edu,Rolf,Ingermann,,Mark Courtney,,['01000102DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],05/23/2001,05/15/2001,04/30/2006,"Costs and Benefits of Female Mate Choice in Pronghorn, Antilocapra americana",Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,L,,

"The University of Idaho proposes to engage 90 students in grades 4-6 and six teachers on two neighboring Indian Reservations in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning through culturally-based and content rich experiences and activities focusing on the large watershed shared by the tribes. The project will deliver a summer and after-school programs for the Coeur d'Alene Reservation.  Students will create a ""virtual watershed"", a web-based site comprised of an interactive map, which will provide geospatial locations of social, cultural, and scientific significance. The proposal is centered on two guiding frameworks, Critical Pedagogy of Place and Adventure Learning. These established frameworks provide a sound foundation for program activities and evaluation. Critical Pedagogy of Place is relevant to the Native American Students in the program. Adventure Learning, with an inquiry-based approach, is well-suited to STEM education. The evaluation is both formative and summative.<br/><br/>The project aims to enhance STEM content understanding, improve attitudes toward STEM careers, and assist in building community partnerships. A design-based approach to STEM instruction using current technology will be used to give students a hands-on culturally based foray into the world of STEM professionals.

However, there are some key outcomes observed in the summer youth STEM camps. The youth participating in the summer camps gained experience in collaboration around inquiry-based group activities (including use of iterative design process), developed physical skills, and gained an understanding of the intertwined nature of STEM and their culture. Overall they displayed an increased positive attitude towards STEM and tribal values (such as caring for the earth), with an overall positive attitude about study in STEM in the future. Additionally, significant evaluation results (survey-based) included gains in feeling connected to place (places where the camps were held), knowing the history of the place, understanding how to collect water quality information, and being able to make a good model for restoring things in nature. Youth interviews indicated that they felt much more connected with their communities, and were excited to learn about their historical language, water, environmental history, and environmental restoration.   Other significant outcomes include those made by the project team in their efforts to develop culturally relevant STEM curriculum and to provide rich camp experiences. During this process, some very deep lessons were learned about tribal-university partnerships. At the very beginning of the project, it was significantly important the project research team put effort in to build relationships with tribal members and communities, including learning about the Tribe?s history, protocols, values, and other culturally significant issues. These lessons brought about deep reflective practices on the parts of many UI team members and a respect for less traditional instructional practices that highlight Indigenous ways of knowing and learning.   Of particular significance, throughout the BTTE project, The University Research Team had come to recognize and better understand the sovereignty of our tribal partners and communities, compelling us to nurture these relationships in a good way. In doing so, it has been essential that we respect and honor the community?s Traditional Knowledge as intellectual property. As with the intellectual property of any group, such as a corporate entity or individual, the dissemination of sensitive and confidential Traditional Knowledge must be preserved and be the purview of stakeholders.   A major outcome that situates the BTTE project, highlighting the partnership with the Tribal communities, is the development of a formal agreement between the University and Tribal partners. To respect the Traditional Knowledge and partnership with the Tribes, data dissemination and management oversight is within the Tribal communities. The data management and dissemination agreement authorizes the Tribe?s Council or appropriate representative, to grant approval for dissemination and distribution of any relevant data related to the Tribe, sensitive or otherwise. Thus, each Tribal community will determine what protected Traditional Knowledge should be and when it can be disseminated.                   Last Modified: 08/21/2016       Submitted by: Anne L Kern"
"This project leverages available AUV Sentry and R/V Atlantis time to implement and test new methods for quantifying heat and fluid fluxes at deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Simultaneous AUV-mounted flow velocity and temperature gradient measurements will be obtained and corrections for vehicle motion will be used to compute flux in/out of a control volume that surrounds the known venting. At Main Endeavour Field on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, the control volume estimates will be compared to the 2000 FlowMow results to better delimit contributions of diffuse flow. At Ashes hydrothermal field on Axial Volcano, a series of surveys at 5 m height will help test the new method for measuring diffuse flow from an AUV. These near-bottom measurements will be validated and synthesized with direct measurements of diffuse and focused flow provided by camera systems deployed for a separate project. Simultaneous measurement of different scales (very near-bottom and 100?s m control volumes) of heat flux and turbulence within the hydrothermal effluent is an expected outcome.

Measurements were obtained at the ASHES and Main Endeavour (MEF) vent fields with the Sentry Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and R/V Atlantis during a 27 day cruise to Axial and MEF in July 2014 and served as the night program for Atlantis (opposite the daytime operations of the manned submersible Alvin). For this research, we equipped the Sentry AUV with a new set of sensors to measure (1) water velocity and (2) temperature. Combined, water temperature and fluid velocities allow us to estimate the heat flux (i.e., the rate of heat transfer per unit area) of the hydrothermal vent field. Measurements of the overall heat and volume flux of a hydrothermal system provide critical, first-order constraints on the energy available for biological communities, the thermal and chemical structure of ocean crust, and the influence of hydrothermal systems on ocean chemistry. Despite the importance of these measurements, very few well constrained values exist. Our research sought to obtain the most accurate values yet for ASHES and MEF and to develop a methodology for future flux surveys at other hydrothermal fields. The obtained measurements reflect the highest resolution water velocity and temperature measurements ever obtained at a hydrothermal vent site. Analysis of the measurements is ongoing.  There were several add-on data sets and research that go beyond the originally proposed goals. First, using water velocity measurements a method was developed to improve underwater robot navigation. Results show that this method is an order of magnitude better than an unaided inertial navigation system. Second, magnetic measurements were collected by the AUV Sentry during surveys at both ASHES and MEF.  These measurements will potentially tell us where fluids are moving beneath the seafloor because hydrothermal fluids often demagnetize crustal rocks, creating an observable magnetic ædead zoneÆ. Finally, high-resolution side-scan sonar data was collected at both vent fields and will greatly improve our understanding of the geological structures around these vent fields.  Outcomes of this research include a conference abstract, 2 conference papers, as well as a submitted and three in-prep journal manuscripts.

Orderly differentiation<br/>and spatial organization of diverse cell types frequently requires that<br/>regulation of cell-specific gene expression be coupled to alterations in<br/>cell cycle regulation.  Ultimately, cellular morphogenesis is driven by<br/>changes in basic processes controlling cell growth, polarity, and asymmetry<br/>in cell division.  The long-term goal of this project is to address<br/>mechanistic questions concerning multicellular development and tissue<br/>formation using the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans.  As in higher<br/>eukaryotes, external and internal signals induce two highly synchronous<br/>developmental events.  Asexual reproduction (conidiation) is characterized<br/>by the spatiotemporal organization of a limited number of differentiated<br/>cell types.  Complex transcriptional regulatory interactions coordinate the<br/>expression of hundreds of cell-specific genes with critical changes in cell<br/>cycle regulation.  A conidiation-independent set of regulatory interactions<br/>controls both tissue formation during sexual reproduction and cell cycle<br/>modifications required during gametogenesis.  The objectives of this<br/>proposal are directed toward elucidating mechanisms that control<br/>multicellular development during conidiation, regulate gametogenesis and<br/>sexual tissue development, and integrate these two reproductive processes.<br/>Specific objectives are focused upon a molecular analysis of the Medusa<br/>(medA), Stunted (stuA) and AnSterile12 (anste12) genes.  MedAp is required<br/>for commitment to the developmental program, functioning as a co-activator<br/>of a subset of conidiation-specific genes and of unknown function in<br/>gametogenesis.  StuAp is an APSES-domain protein that is an essential<br/>component in integrating developmental gene expression and cell cycle<br/>regulation.  The homeodomain protein AnSte12p is related to fungal proteins<br/>known to play essential roles in converting distinct signal transduction<br/>inputs into specific developmental events.  A balance between functions of<br/>StuAp, MedAp and AnSte12p with other developmental regulators establishes<br/>cell-specific morphology in Aspergillus nidulans.<br/><br/>During the proposed funding period a series of interrelated classical<br/>genetic, molecular genetic and biochemical experiments are designed to:  1)<br/>identify DNA response elements within an upstream enhancer required for<br/>developmentally regulated, but BrlAp-, AbaAp-independent expression of<br/>stuA;  2) begin characterization of novel regulatory factors that bind<br/>these response elements;  3) determine if stuA overexpression alone, or in<br/>combination with brlA, alters the cell cycle through modification of G1/S<br/>and/or G2/M checkpoints;  4) continue characterization of extragenic<br/>suppressors of stuA mutations and extragenic mutations that mimic the<br/>stunted phenotype;  5) functionally characterize MedAp - is it a novel<br/>sequence-specific DNA binding protein?;  6) isolate extragenic mutations<br/>that suppress medA -induced growth arrest;  7) physically characterize the<br/>A. nidulans ste12 homolog and begin analysis of the biological role of<br/>AnSte12p in Aspergillus development.  These experiments should provide<br/>important insights into similar mechanisms operating in dimorphic fungi as<br/>well as regulatory features that distinguish homothallic and heterothallic<br/>fungi.  These experiments should also provide a greater understanding of<br/>the diverse strategies used to direct eukaryotic cell differentiation and<br/>responses to environmental factors.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,350000.00,356060,4900,PLANT FUNGAL & MICROB DEV MECH,9817272,,Bruce L Miller,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,bmiller@uidaho.edu,Bruce,Miller,,Susan J.

"Further research on the preparation and properties of fluorine                  compounds is important because the presence of one or more fluorine             atoms or fluorinated groups in molecules has a marked effect on the             chemical and physical properties as well as on the biological activity          of these materials.  The substitution of fluorine for other atoms in a          compound often leads to profound increases in resistance to thermal             degradation or decomposition in water.  These drastic differences in            properties are seen in comparing polyethylene, which does not contain           fluorine, to teflon, which does contain fluorine.

"Plants frequently duplicate their entire genomes, doubling their chromosome number in a process called polyploidization.  Remarkably, not only do these polyploids often thrive, but also make significant contributions to the biodiversity of flowering plants.  However, because newly formed polyploid lineages suffer a broad range of ecological costs, their ubiquity is puzzling.  One possibility, which is evaluated by this research, is that the success of polyploid plants stems from increased resistance to parasites and pathogens.  This hypothesis will be tested using mathematical models and field studies of synthetic polyploid plants.  <br/><br/>Preliminary mathematical results demonstrate that polyploid plants should be initially more resistant than diploids.  Combined with the proposed field studies, this research will investigate how polyploidy shapes pathogen resistance, and may provide a general explanation for the unexpected prevalence of genome duplication within plants.  In addition, this research will provide a unique opportunity for an undergraduate student to receive training at the interface of biology and mathematics.  This student will participate in both the mathematical modeling and field components of the proposed research, allowing them to see how relevant mathematical theory is developed and then tested in the field.  Finally, this research may provide a novel approach to determining the genetic basis of host resistance to pathogens.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,8980.00,8980,4900,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,0808281,,Scott L Nuismer,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,snuismer@uidaho.edu,Scott,Nuismer,,Nancy J.

"The Workshop on Water, Culture, Language, and Native People (WOWCLAN) will be a three-day workshop attended by Indigenous representatives from Siberia, Alaska, and the Pacific Northwest. The workshop is designed to discuss the collection of reliable water quality data in these respective regions, as well as discuss data management and archival techniques for Indigenous data sources. The workshop explores the boundaries and connections between Indigenous Knowledge and western science and will create an ongoing dialogue between Indigenous Peoples and the science community on the issue of water quality and data collection and sharing. <br/><br/>Workshop organizers will train participants in data collection and testing, as well as cultural preservation and documentation. In addition to learning scientific techniques and the use of various monitoring and recording devices, Indigenous participants will have the opportunity to build relationships and exchange views and ideas. Western scientists will gain an understanding of Indigenous needs and perspectives with regard to human health and the environment, as well as a new understanding of water quality in several remote regions that have seen little data collection on this topic. This project will contribute to broader impacts by improving understanding of spatially distinct cultures, advancing cultural understanding, advancing understanding of water quality and, by extension, environmental quality. The effect of blending Indigenous Knowledge with science will lead to greater understanding of human and environmental well-being, with a goal to increased diversity and Indigenous representation in various scientific enterprises.

These rapid changes to the Arctic ecosystem, such as persistent hoarfrost, melting ice, and thawing permafrost directly affect water quality and pose significant risks to traditional practices making the active participation in water quality monitoring even more vital for preserving the delicate balance of the region. The Workshop on Water, Culture, Language, and Native People (WOWCLAN) project was created to address these challenges by hosting and allowing for the open exchange of thought in a series of workshop environments that facilitate interactions between water culture, language, and contemporary science. WOWCLAN presented recommendations from the Arctic Horizons 2017 report and had an overarching goal to build better understandings between Indigenous cultures and western scientific research.  WOWCLAN was attended by Indigenous representatives from the Pacific Northwest, Alaska and Canada (Coeur d?Alene-Schitsu'umsh, Chilkat-Klukwan/Tlingit, Samish Tribes, and Teslin/Tetlit First Nations). The workshops aimed to address the pressing concern of environmental challenges in the Arctic region, particularly the impact of climate change on water quality, and its direct effect on the livelihoods and cultural practices of Indigenous Peoples.  To better understand these unique challenges from remote and diverse populations, and due to global COVID-19 travel restrictions, WOWCLAN provided virtual reality headsets for all participants, and hosted trainings and workshops that harnessed the potential of extended reality (XR) technology. Coupling XR with mobile smart device applications made it possible to bring these communities together in cultural exchange and provide training and professional development opportunities.  The integration of XR technology with water quality data collection offered the participants transformative insights on how their communities could enable themselves to preserve and transmit cultural knowledge, language, traditions, and history to future generations. The XR workshops have resulted in several key co-evolved initiatives and recommendations with far-reaching implications in the future:  Foster Indigenous Knowledge and Language via XR Storytelling: Harness the immersive power of XR technology to revitalize Indigenous storytelling by preserving water culture and language in a dynamic and interactive manner. Conduct personal interviews with respected elders and knowledge holders, capturing their profound wisdom and experiences related to water. By incorporating XR elements into storytelling, we can create compelling narratives that support cultural heritage and language, ensuring its preservation for generations to come. Introduce XR Platforms for Sharing Water Culture: Leverage XR platforms to showcase the beauty and significance of water culture and its interconnection with the natural environment. Through XR experiences, people can immerse themselves in ancestral stories, rituals, and practices, fostering a deeper appreciation for the sacred relationship between water cultural identity. Integrating Indigenous language amplifies the essence of cultural heritage, further strengthening emotional connections to water and its preservation. Evaluate Water Quality Technologies with Cultural Consideration: Conduct comprehensive evaluations of water quality monitoring technologies, considering their compatibility with Indigenous cultural practices and language. Collaborate with community members to assess the applicability, efficacy, and relevance of these technologies in the context of water culture. Respectful evaluations ensure that water quality research respects cultural norms, reinforcing the bond between science and Indigenous heritage. Support Water Quality and XR Education Programs in Indigenous Languages: Facilitate water quality and XR education programs conducted in Indigenous languages. These programs empower community members to actively engage in water quality data collection efforts using XR technology, while preserving and revitalizing native languages.    By respectfully engaging in water quality data collection through XR technology and mobile applications, Indigenous communities are active participants in shaping scientific research, storytelling, and land management. This active involvement not only strengthens connections to the land but also fosters interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. These initiatives present an opportunity for capacity building by providing training and educational resources to community members, equipping them with essential skills for sustainable water resource management.  WOWCLAN provided significant training and professional development opportunities for Indigenous communities. Participants received training in XR technology, data interpretation, environmental monitoring, and collaborative research practices.  Results from WOWCLAN workshops have wide-ranging implications for Indigenous education, language revitalization, and climate change monitoring and adaptation efforts. By empowering Indigenous communities and fostering long-term partnerships, efforts like this will continue to bridge the gap between scientific research and Indigenous Knowledge. The results of the WOWCLAN People project have been disseminated to communities of interest through presentations and panel discussions at the Augmented World Expo (AWE) and the Native Youth Climate and Adaptation Leadership Congress (NYCALC). The dissemination of project outcomes to native youth ensures the sustainability and continuation of these efforts in the future.

"This study proposes to investigate the potential use of                         streptomyces to accomplish coal liquefaction, (streptomyces is a                living microorgranism best known for its ability to produce                     antibiotics).

Coal is one of the largest sources of energy.  However, energy                  demand is greatest for liquid fuels.  Chemical and thermal                      processing for coal liquefaction require extreme conditions of                  temperature, pressure and chemical environment.  Several species                of fungi have been identified that are capable of growing on and                degrading coal.  However, the process of coal solubilization is                 not understood and the products have not been well                              characterized.

"In plant cells, the process of cell division (cytokinesis) forms a cell plate at the site of separation of the two daughter cells.  As cell division proceeds, the cell plate undergoes changes due to transport of new cell wall components to it (exocytosis), and to membrane recycling; both processes must be regulated temporally and spatially.  The protein dynamin, as well as septin-related proteins may participate in the regulation of cell plate formation.  In yeast, septin activity is regulated by a modification process where another protein molecule called SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifiers) is attached to it.  Recently, the Arabidopsis thaliana SUMO conjugating enzyme was found to interact with a cell plate-associated dynamin-related protein.  Whether sumoylation plays a role in cell plate formation in plants is still not known, but can now be tested using this set of proteins.  The hypothesis guiding this project is that sumoylation of plant dynamin-related proteins and septin homologs might initiate the nucleation of other target proteins at the cell plate.  The objectives of the project are to identify cell plate-associated proteins that are modified with SUMO using a combination of biochemistry, molecular biology and proteomics approaches, and to elucidate the function of protein sumoylation and septin homologs in the control of cytokinesis in plants. <br/>Intellectual Merit: Sumoylation plays important roles in diverse biological processes, ranging from protein targeting to transcriptional regulation.  Research into protein sumoylation in plants is just beginning.  The results anticipated from this research may uncover a new function of sumoylation in the control of polar exocytosis not just in plants, but in all eukaryotic cells, and will advance our understanding on how posttranslational modifications of proteins, especially modification by sumoylation, affect cell proliferation and differentiation. <br/>Broader Impacts:  This project will serve as a foundation to train undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the area of plant biochemistry and cell biology.  Dr. Hong's  laboratory will also host training of high school students and high school science teachers during the summer.

"Emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19 can arise when a virus normally circulating within a population of wild animals jumps into the human population. Unfortunately, as we have seen very clearly with COVID-19, once this jump into the human population occurs, it may be too late to stop the infectious disease from spreading rapidly. A novel solution to this problem is to extinguish high-risk pathogens circulating within animal populations before they can jump into the human population. One way this can be accomplished is by developing a vaccine for the animal population that is capable of transmitting itself from one animal to the next, vaccinating each animal against the pathogen as it spreads. Recent advances in genetic engineering have made the development of this sort of self-disseminating vaccine possible. What we do not yet know, however, is if such a vaccine would be an effective tool for eliminating coronaviruses (like the virus that causes COVID-19) from the wild bat populations within which they normally circulate. This research will use mathematical and computational models to evaluate the feasibility of this approach and lay the groundwork for developing new types of vaccines that reduce the risk of emerging infectious disease.  This research project will also support the training of a first generation female graduate student at the interface of mathematics and infectious diseases.<br/><br/>The proposed work will develop mathematical and computational models evaluating the feasibility of using a transmissible vaccine to reduce the prevalence of SARS-like coronaviruses within wild Rhinolophus bat populations. These models will be parameterized using published data on coronavirus prevalence and seroprevalence within wild bat populations and data on bat population structure, demography, and ranging behavior.  Parameterized models will predict the outcome of interventions employing vaccine vectors with different degrees of transmissibility and thus set boundaries on the vectors that could be used to engineer an effective transmissible vaccine. In addition to advancing our ability to reduce the threat of emerging infectious disease, the proposed work will provide training at the interface of mathematics and infectious disease for a graduate student.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,56420.00,56420,4900,COVID-19 Research,2028162,,Scott L Nuismer,875 Perimeter Drive,Moscow,US,"ID""",Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838443051,snuismer@uidaho.edu,Scott,Nuismer,sscheine@nsf.gov,Samuel Scheiner,7032927175,['010N2021DB R&RA CARES Act DEFC N'],04/22/2020,04/15/2020,12/31/2021,EAGER: Evaluating the feasibility of a transmissible vaccine within bat populations.,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,"['James J Bull', 'Christopher H Remien']",L,," Although most spillover events do not lead to major epidemics or pandemics, chronic and predictable spillover sickens hundreds of thousands of people each year. In those rare cases like SARS-CoV-2 where spillover seeds a pandemic, the toll on human health can be immense. One way to reduce the risk of pathogen spillover is to develop vaccines that target important human pathogens within their wildlife reservoirs. Although this approach has been used successfully to reduce the risk of rabies in North America, it is has proven challenging to achieve for most other wildlife diseases.  A key obstacle has been distributing enough vaccine into hard-to-reach populations of wild animals.  One solution put forward to enable the efficient immunization of wild animal populations is to use vaccines capable of self-dissemination. Self-disseminating vaccines make wildlife vaccination more practical because for each directly immunized animal, additional animals become vaccinated for ""free"". Work on this project used mathematical and computational models to explore the feasibility of immunizing wild animal populations using self-disseminating vaccines. The key contribution of work on this project has been the integration of seasonality into mathematical models of self-disseminating vaccines. By allowing for seasonal pulses of reproduction, these models integrate an important feature of many wildlife reservoir populations likely to influence the effectiveness of self-disseminating vaccines.  Using a combination of mathematical and computational analyses work on this project demonstrated that the beneficial impact of self-disseminating vaccines can be maximized by timing their introduction to coincide with the peak of seasonal reproduction. Timing the introduction of the vaccine in this way minimizes the wasteful vaccination of individuals who have been previously infected by the pathogen and maximizes the potential for vaccine self-dissemination. These results provide important practical guidelines for wildlife vaccination campaigns of the future that capitalize on self-disseminating vaccines.  In addition to advancing our understanding of self-disseminating vaccines, work on this project has contributed to human resource development through the training of a graduate student. Specifically, this work has provided training in the development and analysis of mathematical models and effective written and verbal communication.

"Many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have a circadian ""clock"" that coordinates rhythms of gene expression and physiology that serve to anticipate changes in the day/night cycle, and which persist under constant conditions in the absence of environmental cues. The photosynthetic Cyanobacteria are the simplest organisms known to display circadian rhythms; among the cyanobacteria, Synechococcus elongatus has the smallest known genome (~2.7 Mb). This unicellular organism requires light for growth, and offers many advantages for understanding the molecular mechanism of the circadian clock, including its transformability and efficient systems of homologous recombination. The genes required for clock function and synchronization by light in S. elongatus will be identified in the context of determining its complete genome sequence.<br/>Because S. elongatus has a very small genome, it is a model organism in which to isolate and characterize mutations that affect the clock mechanism, its sensitivity to light, and its connection to cellular functions. A cosmid library consisting of 45 kb inserts of S. elongatus genomic DNA will be made, then ordered by the genetic method of complementation. This ordering method will reveal the organization of this organism's biosynthetic functions, functions common to all complex genomes. Subclones in this library will be mutagenized with the insertion element MudS to generate mutant pools corresponding to each region of the genome. These MudS insertions will be crossed onto the S. elongatus genome to generate mutants, and simple screens will be used to identify insertions in genes required for clock function and regulation. These MudS insertions will also be used as starting points for the determination both of the genome sequence, and of the locations of these mutations within the genome sequence. This new function-based approach to genome mapping and sequencing will be more informative and less costly than current, random sequencing approaches. The sequence of the S. elongatus genome, when combined with an understanding of the effects of mutations in the genome, will reveal the most minimal set of functions required for both the clock mechanism and photosynthetic metabolism. Because of the close evolutionary relationship between S. elongatus and plant chloroplasts, understanding the S. elongatus genome will provide a simpler basis for understanding the more complex genomics of higher plants.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,300000.00,100000,4900,MICROBIAL GENETICS,9907528,,Patricia L Hartzell,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,hartzell@uidaho.edu,Patricia,Hartzell,,Philip Harriman,,,03/29/1999,04/15/1999,03/31/2001,Collaborative Research:  Functional Analysis of the Synechococcus PCC 7942 Genome,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,L,,
"Coevolution plays a central role in shaping biological diversity, molding the structure of biological communities, and driving tight coadaptation between interacting species. Over shorter ecological time scales coevolution also generates chronic maladaptation and maintains substantial levels of genetic polymorphism. The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution provides a unifying framework for these disparate aspects of the coevolutionary process. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a rigorous theoretical backbone for this theory. This will be achieved through the application of recently developed mathematical techniques that greatly simplify the analysis of complex genetic systems. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposed work are twofold. First, the models will extend previously developed mathematical techniques to coevolving systems. The result will be the development of new and powerful analytical tools that can be readily applied to a diverse array of problems in coevolutionary biology. The distribution of this analytical technology will be facilitated by public presentation of techniques at annual meetings, and by the publication of electronic Mathematica appendices. Second, the training component of the proposed work will introduce two graduate students and an undergraduate to these new mathematical techniques, as well as other computational and analytical approaches. This training will directly contribute to the increased integration of analytical and computational techniques in the biological sciences. <br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,236601.00,242601,4900,Evolutionary Processes,0343023,,Scott L Nuismer,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,snuismer@uidaho.edu,Scott,Nuismer,,Nancy J.

"The objective of this project to is study structural variations in a family of intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUP). Based on the PI's previous work, and the work of others, it is now clear that IUPs form a diverse set of protein families that can elicit biological function using a variety of mechanisms. This project has two aims: (I) Determine structural ensembles for a set of homologous proteins that are intrinsically unstructured. In this specific aim, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement will be used to estimate long-range interatomic distances that can be used to restrain structure calculations. The structural ensembles will then be validated using residual dipolar couplings and small angle x-ray scattering. (II) Determine the relationship between sequence identity and structural similarity for a set of homologous proteins that are intrinsically unstructured. In this specific aim, eigenvector decomposition of protein contact maps will be used to identify similarities between the structural ensembles. This data will then be correlated with genetic distance matrices to determine the percent sequence identity necessary for structural similarity. Experiments in this specific aim will also test the importance of amino acid composition for specifying the structural ensemble. Successful completion of both specific aims will facilitate the development of models of protein evolution for intrinsically unstructured proteins that can be used to estimate their dynamic structures based on sequence identity. <br/><br/>The PI has a strong record of advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning. This is evidenced by the three peer reviewed publications that have undergraduate students as authors and five peer reviewed publications that have authors from underrepresented groups.  The PI is also very committed in disseminating scientific information to general public. In the summer of 2004, the PI participated in a state funded workshop for secondary education to science teachers. The PI gave lectures on the general principles of protein structure and function as well as a tutorial for using molecular graphics programs in the classroom. This project will involve two undergraduate students and a female research technician and the PI will continue his efforts to involve science teachers in basic scientific research by holding an annual workshop whose purpose would be to introduce science teachers to the latest breakthroughs and make them aware of new web-based tools for scientific discovery. <br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,578860.00,289522,4900,Molecular Biophysics,0744839,,Gary W Daughdrill,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,gdaughdrill@usf.edu,Gary,Daughdrill,,Kamal Shukla,,"['01000809DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT', '01000910DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT']",04/15/2008,04/15/2008,06/30/2009,Determining Structural Ensembles for Intrinsically Unstructured Proteins,Continuing Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,W,"['PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS~2008~73~Lowry, DF; Hausrath, AC; Daughdrill, GW~10.1002/prot.2211~918~928~~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=174769032#000261129300011~A robust approach for analyzing a heterogeneous structural ensemble~Y~~~~~~']",
"The underrepresentation of American Indian people in graduate level science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research and education is an issue that must be addressed in order to safeguard the future of Native American communities and Nations, and to ensure a viable, healthy, national STEM workforce. This project creates a national program for Indigenous STEM Research and Graduate Education (ISTEM) that has a focus of a Regional Native Network (RN2) of nine institutions of higher education. Led by the University of Idaho, ISTEM aims to increase the number of Native American students obtaining Masters and PhD degrees in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The ISTEM program is a unique national program that provides comprehensive STEM graduate training to address the needs and desires of Native American peoples. In consultation with tribal communities and a Native American national advisory board, ISTEM addresses the specific needs of both Native American graduate students and their tribes through a collaborative approach (RN2) to recruitment, research design, and retention of STEM graduate students. During the project period, ISTEM is partially experimental with ongoing program modifications based on assessment.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>Many components of the ISTEM curriculum and programmatic structure are drawn from existing models that have been effective in the training of graduate students from underrepresented minority populations. The program will incorporate both accepted and experimental components, including: (1) new modalities of teaching and learning that have American Indian input; (2) collaborative, interdisciplinary research based on a cohort model of students interacting with stakeholders; and (3) situating STEM into social and cultural contexts so that the theory of knowledge is woven into good teaching and learning. The results of the program will inform future program design in graduate STEM education, and encourage research into delivering more effective graduate education to underrepresented segments of the population.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The ISTEM program is focused on the creation of a core of STEM professionals from an underrepresented group, namely American Indian peoples of the United States. The program directly benefits society by providing American Indian scholars access to research facilities and methodologies for exploring ongoing issues of concern to tribal and Native American lands and peoples. Additionally, ISTEM is advancing STEM discovery and understanding through RN2, its collaborative, stakeholder-centric approach to research and education design.

One of the students was the first STEM doctorate earned by his respective tribe. Our students demonstrated the importance of research that addresses issues facing their Tribal communities. They have come to understand that they are the next generation of American Indian ISTEM Scholars and the mentoring, role model responsibilities that they carry. ISTEM Scholars have created knowledge across a variety of areas in the STEM disciplines. This knowledge creation was done through Two-Eyed Seeing, the importance of a Native worldview brought together with a Western academic worldview. Through the broadening of participation, these ISTEM Scholars are positioned to ask questions and conduct research that it is on the cutting edge.  Here is what some of the ISEM students thought about the ISTEM program.  What does it mean to you to be an ISTEM Scholar?  S1        ?It means that I have the opportunity to give back to my community in a way that can help improve the quality of life for Indigenous people and provide a pathway to students beginning or currently on their educational journey.?  S2        ?It?s definitely the crucial lifeline I needed, which interestingly presented itself in a timely fashion, to continue forward toward completing a Master?s degree in biology.?  S3        ?It means quite a lot to me! I have spent much of my academic career teaching American Indian Studies courses, advising native students, and working more recently on environmental issues and co-management of resources and lands directly relevant to American Indian communities in the Western US. I was very fortunate to have worked with Dr. Galindo on writing a previous iteration of the ISTEM grant to the NSF, and feel honored that I?ve been chosen as an ISTEM scholar. This is, to me, the greatest honor I?ve received so far in my academic life.?  S4        ?For me, being a student in the ISTEM program represents an opportunity. Having this scholarship has allowed me to take a course from my local university while remaining at home. If not for this scholarship, I would not have had the financial means to enroll in classes. I am very proud to be an ISTEM scholar and hope that I can continue to be a part of this exciting journey.?  S5        ?Up until this point I never really realized the distinction that is accompanied by being recognized as an ISTEM scholar. I understand now this honor exhibits each scholar?s potential to do great science and their potential to be the next great intellectuals of this time period. We are a group of students that can break barriers and open new opportunities for others like ourselves.?  S6        ?I am supported as an indigenous scientist to express my nativeness in the realm of science without a community of other scholars like me.?  S7        ?Being an ISTEM scholar has allowed me to communicate with other native scholars from diverse tribal backgrounds. This has been a valuable experience and has help to define what it means to be an ISTEM scholar. This ability to connect with other native scholar provides a level of accountability in our discipline specific scholarly work and in understandings of native perspectives within the academic community.?  What is your intellectual motivation?   S1        ?I am always looking to learn new things, particularly in the areas of cosmology and astrophysics.  There is so much we don't know about the universe (multiverses) and I am intrigued by the prospect of one day finding life exists outside of our own sphere of influence.?  S2        ?I believe it stems from my upbringing and family history. I attribute my intellectual motivation to an understanding of the sacrifices of those who have come before me. I have seen and experienced the hard work and challenge(s) my grandmother and mother lived without receiving a western education, but they still managed to provide a way to make it in an ever demanding, technologically evolving bureaucratic society.  It also stems from culture, tribal history and a desire to do better and make contributions to family and community. I don?t want to let them down so to speak.  It was a true honor to work with such a bright, compassionate group of American Indian Scholars. I am proud of all of them.

"This research will increase the fundamental understanding of both temporal and spatial variability of Arctic clouds. Knowledge of Arctic cloud properties is important for understanding the overall energy balance of the Arctic, and how Arctic climate interacts with the global climate system. There have been many short-term field experiments to study Arctic clouds at specific locations, but there is a lack of knowledge regarding the temporal and spatial variability of cloud properties across the Arctic. The longest record of data exists at the North Slope of Alaska ARM site, but this is only at a single location. New data are now available from other ground-based sites that complement the measurements in Alaska and broaden our understanding of Arctic clouds. This group will combine these ground-based measurements at various sites with satellite observations to make a network of cloud observations across the Arctic.<br/><br/>Arctic clouds will be one of the important indicators signifying if, and when, the Arctic system is moving to a new climatic state. The work of data integration and analysis of Arctic cloud observations will yield a significant contribution to the legacy of infrastructure and data that will result from the IPY.<br/><br/>The proposed work specifically addresses the following four questions:<br/>What are the macrophysical and microphysical properties of clouds at various locations in the Arctic? A comprehensive suite of macro- and micro-physical cloud property retrieval algorithms will be applied to Arctic cloud measurements from various surface sites. The derived products will provide a baseline of Arctic cloud properties upon which to identify and understand future change, and to validate models.<br/><br/>How do Arctic cloud properties vary both temporally and spatially? Multi-year records of cloud observations from Barrow, Alaska and Eureka, Canada will be used to investigate inter-annual cloud variability. Additionally, time periods of overlapping measurements at the different stations are expected to provide important insight into the spatial dependence of cloud properties.<br/><br/>How do the spatial and temporal variability of Arctic cloud properties depend upon regional ""forcing"" parameters? Using ancillary data at each surface site, differences or similarities in cloud properties, and their variability, will be associated with regional meteorological properties that contribute to the forcing of cloud formation to explain the observed variability.<br/><br/>Do satellite retrievals yield similar cloud properties and variability to the coincident surface-based measurements?

"The goals of this work on pronghorn, a native North American hoofed animal, are to investigate the effects of a population bottleneck on breeding behavior. The study will complete the construction of a complete population pedigree, measure the effects of inbreeding on reproduction, and see whether females, in their mate choice decisions, are able to avoid inbreeding. In doing so, females may be able to balance inbreeding avoidance with mate choice for genetically superior males. It is possible to achieve these goals because of long-term records, as well as a recent and rare population event, for the pronghorn population at the National Bison Range in northwestern Montana. <br/><br/>Results from this work will be of direct use to wildlife managers, who set hunting dates, harvest levels, and target population sizes for pronghorn in 14 western states. The project will make available information on genetic markers for this species. The project will train 2 female Ph.D. students, and will involve at least 16 undergraduates, half of whom will be from under-represented groups, in field and laboratory aspects of the research.

A bottleneck occurs when natural events cause a populationÆs size to decline significantly and suddenly. In this case the pronghorn population at the National Bison Range, a closed, 30 square-mile wildlife refuge in Northwestern Montana, suffered severe over-winter mortality in 2004, following the unusually hot and dry summer of 2003. About 30% of adult females, and 90% of adult males died.     This natural experiment gave us the opportunity to study inbreeding in the wild.  Because this was a continuation of a long-term study, in which all individuals were marked and characterized genetically, we were able to construct a complete, 6-generation population pedigree. The pedigree allowed us to calculate the exact degree of inbreeding of each pronghorn fawn born during the study period.     Armed with this information, we showed, first, that there was significant inbreeding depression.  This is, the more inbred a fawn was, the lower its overall condition at birth, and the lower its chances of survival to weaning at age 12 weeks.  Second, we showed that pronghorn females are able, most of the time, to avoid inbreeding.  In the two weeks before estrus, pronghorn females engage in a process of mate sampling, in which they visit many males and make repeated visits to some.  Females have complete control over their mating decisions, and they usually mate once.  We showed that the overall level of inbreeding among fawns born during the study was lower than would be expected if females mated at random.  Thus, females somehow were able to avoid mating with close relatives most of the time.     Finally, we observed females during the mate sampling process, to discover the behavioral mechanisms by which inbreeding avoidance is achieved.  Females did not avoid visiting closely related males and they permitted these males to court them.  However, courtship between a female and a related male progressed more slowly, especially in the late stages of courtship that immediately preceded copulation.  Thus, females are less receptive to courtship by related males, and they apparently require close contact with the male to make this behavioral adjustment. The nature of the information that females use to discriminate between relatives and non-relatives remains unknown.     Our discoveries add to a growing list of species in which deleterious effects of inbreeding have been shown in nature. Our results will be important to wildlife managers, who are charged with maintaining the stability of natural populations.  Specifically, following population decline, it would be wise to introduce new individuals from other populations, to minimize inbreeding effects. Also, it is clear that the unfettered ability of females to choose mates is important. Hunting seasons should be adjusted so that hunts do not coincide with the pronghorn mating season.

"Abstract Proposal Title: SGER Electrochemical Detection of Peroxide-Based Explosives Proposal Number: CBET-0707038 Principal Investigator: I. F Cheng,  Institution: University of Idaho<br/><br/><br/>From an Intellectual Merit perspective, there is an urgent need for methods and techniques that are able to detect quantitatively and qualitatively peroxide based explosives. The basic chemistries for such endeavor have not been fully described. This investigation will examine the electrochemical mediation of the Fenton Reaction as a basis for detection of this class of explosives. The mediation takes place as a result of the homogeneous Fenton Reaction and the electro-reduction of an FeIII complex to FeII. FeIIcomplex + RO-OR  FeIIIcomplex + RO- + RO.. The current due to the electro-reduction of the FeIII complex is proportional to the square root of the peroxide concentration. The process is expected to be rapid, robust, and inexpensive. The proposed study will examine the detection limits, kinetics and the role of the chelate of that iron complex. The latter is based on considerations of the structure-activity relationships developed by cyclic voltammetric studies.<br/><br/>This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) seeks to prove that this novel approach to detection of peroxide based explosives can be utilized and will have Broader Impacts. If successful, the PI anticipates that this SGER proposal will lead to a more detailed EXP proposal where the Fentons Reagent-based system will be further explored and characterized within a carefully crafted experimental and teaching plan, additionally the PI may seek further funding for these concepts from other government agencies as well as other NSF program elements.<br/><br/><br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.041,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,0.00,70032,4900,Nanoscale Interactions Program,0707038,,IFrancis F Cheng,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,ifcheng@uidaho.edu,IFrancis,Cheng,,Rosemarie D.

"The project is designed to develop, implement and assess an educational model intended to improve Native American student science identity through culturally relevant use of technology that can directly improve the well being of their communities.  The project will engage 90 low-income, high school Native American students from the rural Nez Perce Reservation in Idaho through a program of educational activities centered on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and remote sensing. The students will be trained in UAV use focused on remote sensing of Tribal ecosystems, as well as in science communication and leadership, as part of an enhanced curriculum during an immersive residential summer program at the University of Idaho (McCall) Outdoor Science School campus, located on ancestral Nez Perce Tribal lands. During the academic year, the students at will take part in learning activities focused upon UAV and remote sensing technologies, including virtual field trips, guest speakers, and other instruction delivered via videoconference. Students will take part in hands-on remote sensing and mapping activities of ecosystems that are integral to their culture such as riparian ecosystems (which support traditional and current Tribal fisheries) and forest ecosystems. Each school year will culminate in a large-scale mapping project that will be chosen and designed, based on student and Nez Perce community member input.  <br/><br/>The project will investigate two central research hypotheses: that science identity is increased in Native American students when they engage in technology-based projects that directly relate to their community/cultural interests, and that interest and achievement by students in STEM education is sustained when community involvement is central to the approach. The project will collect data related to three constructs of science identity theory: competence, performance and recognition. Methods will include pre- and post-program surveys, assessment of STEM concepts, reflective journaling, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, observations, and longitudinal data collection.

The work explored Indigenous epistemologies and cosmologies in presenting STEM concepts. By connecting students to learning that emerged from observations of the land, through stories from elders and community members, and through developing their own projects, students were able to broaden their conception of what it means to do science and to develop meaningful connections between themselves and the scientific enterprise. The work resulted in curricular products ? an Indigenous environmental science course, and a written field-based and classroom-based curriculum. Three master?s level students and one doctoral student were trained in Indigenous pedagogy and research methodologies. Broader Impacts: This work impacted 119 high school students (52% Native American), and six high school teachers through three summer camps. Twenty education, natural resources, and fisheries professionals from the Nez Perce Tribe were involved in planning and conducting the work alongside faculty and staff from the University of Idaho. The work has been shared at AGU and through the American Indian/Alaska Native Working Group of the NASA Science Mission Directorate.

"This award provides partial support for Professor Marc J. Klowden,              Division of Entomology, University of Idaho, to spend his sabbatical            in the laboratory of Hans Briegel, Institute of Zoology, University             of Zurich.  They share an interest in how endogenous factors regulate           insect behavior, and they will collaborate in a study of how several            humoral factors, present during egg development in the mosquito,                inhibit host seeking and increase the attraction to oviposition                 sites.  Professor Klowden's approach until now has largely been to              use microsurgery, involving gland ablation and transplantation.                 Through collaboration with Dr. Briegel and others at Zurich, he                 expects to learn their biochemical approach, including techniques for           fractionating the components in the male accessory glands.  His                 research goals for this six-month visit are to extract the accessory            gland components of male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, test the                     individual components for their behavioral effects in gravid females,           and identify the components that show activity in the pre-oviposition           bioassay.                                                                                                                                                       Although pre-oviposition behavior does not directly influence the               vector potential of a mosquito population, it is a major factor in              reproductive success and the maintenance of adult population                    densities.  In order to understand better the epidemiology of                   mosquito-borne diseases, it is helpful also to understand the                   mechanisms that control mosquito behavior and how the female comes to           express a particular behavior at a particular time.  It is                      conceivable that natural products could be identified that interfere            with the pre-oviposition behavior of many different insects; however,           the mechanisms that regulate this behavior need to be understood                first.

"0004067<br/>Geist<br/><br/>This grant provides partial support to acquire continuously-monitoring GPS units that will be installed on Sierra Negra volcano in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.  Several technological breakthroughs now enable the deployment of a continuous monitoring, high-precision GPS network in a remote setting at reasonable cost.  The network to be developed in this proposal will comprise four single frequency GPS instruments with two dual frequency instruments, one of which will serve as a base station.  Data will be continually streamed from the single frequency receivers to the base via radiomodem, where it will then be relayed in near real time via VSAT to UNAVCO in Boulder.  The data will then be available via ftp to the principal investigator at the University of Idaho for processing.  The network will be deployed on Sierra Negra volcano in the Galapagos archipelago.  Sierra Negra has been chosen for a variety of reasons.  First, satellite interferometry indicates that Sierra Negra is currently experiencing some of the fastest uplift rates of any volcano on the planet, on order of 50 cm/y.  Second, the remote location of the Galapagos provides a robust test for deployment and operation of such a system, to demonstrate that it can be used to monitor virtually any volcano in this hemisphere.  Although the archipelago is remote, Sierra Negra is relatively accessible, the PI has a great deal of logistical experience there, and the project will be supported by the Charles Darwin Research Station.  Third, there are several projects currently being undertaken with the goal of understanding deformation of Sierra Negra's caldera (annual campaign GPS,  fracture mapping, and monthly INSAR measurements). These are expected to dramatically increase our understanding of the uplift at Sierra Negra, and the deformation processes leading to caldera formation in general.<br/><br/>***<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,46484.00,46484,4900,Instrumentation & Facilities,0004067,,Dennis J Geist,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,dgeist@uidaho.edu,Dennis,Geist,,Russell Kelz,,['01000102DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],03/15/2001,02/15/2001,01/31/2003,Development of an Inexpensive Continuous GPS System for Remote Monitoring of Volcano Deformation,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,J,,
"CMMI-9318776, PI-NIELSON:  Existing architectural precast curtain wall panels may have nonductile connection details that are prone to failure in strong earthquakes.  They also may have experienced significant corrosion of the reinforcing steel.  Corrosion of the bars anchoring the panel connection inserts likewise reduces the strength and ductility of the panel connections.  This project conducts a study to investigate remedial procedures which will increase the seismic integrity of the panels during earthquakes.  Successful rehabilitation schemes are developed to satisfy the following criteria:  (1) provide adequate strength to resist both seismic code design forces and forces generated by structural response to actual earthquake ground motions, (2) provide adequate ductility to accommodate realistic interstory drifts, (3) accommodate a variety of structural framing schemes including both steel and reinforced concrete, (4) be practical and economical,  requiring minimal disruption of a building's functions, and (5) reduce or eliminate the possibility of corrosion of the panel reinforcement, and possibly reduce the seismic dead load and lateral design load for the structure.  Research tasks to achieve these are:  (1) Construct and test nonductile connection details.  (2) Design appropriate repair schemes.  (3) Construct and test repair details and verify their performance.  (4) Perform dynamic analyses of full-panel repair systems.

"This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry   program supports research in the laboratories of Professor Jean'ne   Shreeve at the University of Idaho.  Shreeve has proposed to develop a   new class of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl electrophilic transfer agents   based upon simple inorganic molecules.  The proposal clearly outlines a   variety of synthetic routes for the preparation of these reagents.    Although a variety of perfluoroalkyl transfer agents are known, these   reagents often require the use of tedious synthetic methodologies or   possess a limited scope of applicability. The new reagents to be   developed are expected to offer the advantages of being applicable to the   derivatization of a variety of template molecules and being stable in the   presence of nucleophiles and under photolytic conditions.  Additional   studies will include the nucleophilic transfer of per- and   poly-fluoroalkyl groups from the corresponding per- and   poly-fluoroalkylated silanes.  The incorporation of fluorine or fluorine-containing groups into   molecules has a marked effect upon the chemical and physical properties   of the parent molecule.  These changes result in increased lipophilicity   and improved hydrolytic and thermal stability.  As a result, the demand   for such compounds by the pharmaceutical, medical and polymer industries   continues to grow.

"The purpose of the proposed research is to define the dynamic loads             generated by in-situ occupant movements.  The work will focus on the            coherence of motion (i.e., the group effect) associated with public             assembly occupancies.  The investigation will be conducted through three        goal-oriented tasks devoted to:  a) analytically modeling the group             effect by spatially and temporally extrapolating loads produced by              individuals; b) experimentally measuring the group effect on a                  prototypical floor system; and c) using the analytical models developed         to produce structural load criteria.  The work begun under a former             grant wherein periodic, transient, and random dynamic loads produced by         individuals were studied will be extended.  Data from an existing force         platform will be utilized for a limited population to mathematically            model group loads in both the time and frequency domains.  Approximate          design envelopes for both load amplitude and frequency will be produced         and test sample sizes will be determined for the third task.  The group         load models will be verified with a full-scale floor system constructed         from lightweight components.

"Explosive volcanic eruptions often produce pyroclastic density currents, ground-hugging mixtures of particles and hot gas that are denser than the ambient atmosphere. Pyroclastic density currents rapidly propagate in the lowest levels of the atmosphere where they can directly impact human population centers and structures, and are some of the most hazardous volcanic phenomena. Pyroclastic density currents erupted at Cotopaxi in 1877 and at Tungurahua in 2006 and 2008 were produced by a little understood process described as ""boiling-over"". During a boiling-over eruption, a dense froth of pyroclasts and gas pours over the crater rim or through a notch in the crater, creating a pyroclastic density current. The mechanism for the formation of boiling-over pyroclastic density currents differs in important ways from those that result from the collapse of lava-domes or high convective columns, and the deposits are distinctive. Boiling-over eruptions are likely common but under-recognized in the geologic record, as most are associated with relatively small volume eruptions of volatile-rich mafic to intermediate magmas.  This project, which is supported by the Petrology&amp;Geochemistry program and the Americas Program (OISE) is a multidisciplinary, international collaborative effort in which numerical modeling and field studies will be integrated to characterize boiling-over deposits, determine why this style of eruption occurs, and understand the transport of the resulting density currents. <br/><br/>In particular, this proposal focuses on two fundamental questions designed to advance our understanding of pyroclastic density currents: 1. What conduit conditions result in boiling-over dynamics? 2. What are the relative contributions of eroded substrate and entrained air in boiling-over eruptions, and how does this influence pyroclastic density current dynamics? It is proposed to use 2D multiphase numerical models to test whether the presence of an enclosed summit crater enhances the decompression rate, allowing for a rapid sequence of exsolution and microlite crystallization over a limited spatial domain. The results of this study will have general applicability to volcanoes worldwide. The research team will also use petrographic and volatile content observations from the field studies at Cotopaxi and Tungurahua as a crucial test of the fidelity of the modeling program. They will test the hypothesis that after exiting the summit crater, a particle-dense, bed load region in the pyroclastic flows develops rapidly. This bed load region, which is constituted of particles that make multiple and enduring contacts with the substrate, may enhance erosion and gas pore pressure, and suppress ambient air-entrainment resulting in longer runout distances of these flows. Detailed analysis of deposit architecture, paleomagnetic measurements, and granulometry along with a 3D granular multiphase computational approach will be used to examine the role of entrainment in the propagation of these flows. One of the many novel aspects of the proposed investigation is the use of thermal proxies, including thermoremanent magnetization, in conjunction with the numerical models to constrain the thermal consequences of entrainment.",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,85638.00,85638,4900,Petrology and Geochemistry,0838153,,Dennis J Geist,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,dgeist@uidaho.edu,Dennis,Geist,,Sonia Esperanca,,['01000910DB NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT'],02/13/2009,02/15/2009,01/31/2013,Collaborative Research: Boiling-Over Pyroclastic Flows,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,J,,

"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).<br/><br/>Adapting to climate change is a fundamental challenge for life on Earth. As organisms are forced to move in search of hospitable habitat, species leave areas no longer favorable and expand into new areas, or they go extinct. These events are playing out across North America’s Madrean Pine-Oak woodlands, a biodiversity hotspot, as increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation push the endemic organisms further up the mountains. The sky islands are natural laboratories perfect for evolutionary studies because each sky island can be thought of as a replicate, with each representing a time point in an ongoing natural experiment. With one-fifth of the world’s invertebrates at risk for extinction, species with a limited ability to move, like the long-lived Aphonopelma – the only tarantula genus in the United States - are of particular concern. If these species are lost to extinction before discovery, this biodiversity knowledge will be lost forever. This research will inform our understanding of island biogeography theory and the evolutionary history of the Madrean Pine-Oak Woodlands biodiversity hotspot. Importantly, this biodiversity hotspot is found within the sovereign land of the Apache and Tohono O’odham peoples. This land, its geology, and the flora and fauna holds significant scientific and cultural knowledge (Traditional Ecological Knowledge – TEK) for these tribes. Gained through thousands of years of living with the land, tribes have an intimate understanding of the interconnections between people and the environment (e.g., how climate change has altered the seasonal patterns and distributions of sky island biodiversity). The goal of this research is to integrate Western science and TEK to better understand the evolutionary patterns and processes that led to the remarkable radiation of Aphonopelma spiders throughout the sky islands, and how climate change is going to impact this diversity in the future. The education component of this project will develop a unique STEM program for San Carlos Apache K-12 students that integrates their TEK with modern research to show them how they can become the next generation of protectors of their tribe’s natural resources.<br/><br/>The overarching question this research looks to answer is whether the Madrean Archipelago has been a generator for North American tarantula diversity. Specifically, this research will use genome data to understand if the sky island Aphonopelma species evolved once or many times. This will allow the researchers to determine what advantageous changes in the genome occurred when species moved into the sky islands and diversified by adapting to new habitats, and whether sky island species will be able to adapt to global climate change. Lastly, the researchers will work with San Carlos Apache elders to show tribal K-12 students how TEK and Western science can be utilized together to better understand the world around them.

"How quickly can new species form, and how predictable is evolution in nature? This project will address these questions in an ideal setting to study evolution in action.  Multiple lizard species have evolved white coloration for camouflage in the gypsum dunes of White Sands, New Mexico. These species are undergoing the process of speciation on an extraordinarily rapid timescale. This project will illuminate the factors that accelerate the process of speciation in White Sands lizards. Field studies in nature and genetics studies in the lab will be used to understand how natural selection can lead so quickly to adaptation and speciation. <br/><br/>The white lizards at White Sands provide a compelling, accessible example of evolution and represent a tremendous opportunity for research and public outreach. From an educational perspective this grant will increase scientific literacy and demystify evolutionary concepts for the public. The research will be integrated with educational outreach activities that use the dramatic landscape of White Sands to teach evolutionary biology to the general public.

"9321893  Hartzell  The carbon source requirements of all known methanogens are limited to simple C1 and C2 compounds such as CO2, methanol, formate, and acetate despite the fact that methanogenesis from higher molecular weight carbon sources would be sufficiently exergonic for growth.  Current anaerobic digestion processes for methane production involve three basic steps: solubilization, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis.  These processes are carried out by different microbial consortia with different pH optima.  The goal of this project is to engineer a microbe capable of methanogenesis from complex substrates.  This will improve the rate and efficiency of anaerobic digestion processes for methane production.  The organism, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, is an extremely thermophilic (83 degrees C) sulfate-reducing Archaeon that grows on a broad range of carbon sources including peptone, starch, and gelatin.  A. fulgidus has been referred to as ""the evolutionary missing link"" between the methanogens and the sulfate metabolizers as it utilizes all but the final enzymes involved in methanogenesis. In this exploratory project, both mutation/selection strategies and gene transfer techniques are being used to create a broad-substrate-range methanogen from A. fulgidus.  %%%  Success in genetically engineering Archaeolglobus should lead to a major improvement in the rate and efficiency of production of methane, a desirable energy source.  ***",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,50000.00,50000,4900,Molecular Biophysics,9321893,,Patricia L Hartzell,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,hartzell@uidaho.edu,Patricia,Hartzell,,Philip Harriman,,,12/20/1994,01/15/1995,12/31/1996,SGER: Genetic Engineering of Archaeoglobus Fulgidus,Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,['Ronald L Crawford'],L,,
"This project will develop and validate a novel cooperative, co-evolutionary algorithm design for multi-agent systems: Orthogonal Evolution of Teams (OET). Many real-world problems are too large and too complex to expect a single, monolithic intelligent agent to solve them successfully. Monolithic agents tend to overlook specialized sub-domains within a larger problem space and thus to make errors on those sub-domains. As problems grow progressively larger and more complex, this weakness will become increasingly critical. Thus, considerable research has focused on team or ensemble approaches, generating agents that consist of integrated subsystems each of which is specialized to find solutions within a sub-domain of the total problem space. For a team approach to succeed it must meet two criteria: The team members must be relatively successful and the team members must collaborate in a way that improves the performance of the team as a whole. <br/><br/>Research has shown that evolutionary techniques are effective and broadly applicable to the evolution of teams. However, existing evolutionary approaches have significant weaknesses. They either produce relatively poor team members, or they do not sufficiently encourage specialization between the team members. The specific aim of this research is to investigate OET's ability to meet the two criteria and to validate its performance as compared to other team approaches on a number of problems, including artificial problems specifically designed to test features of its performance, typical test problems from the evolutionary computation and classification fields, and the real-world problem of identifying disordered regions in proteins. Validation will include using the predicted fault (or error) rate model to measure the specialization of the team members with OET and with other team based learning algorithms, comparison of results with OET to benchmark algorithms and published results, and entering an OET based algorithm in the biannual Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment. <br/><br/>The results will lead to significantly improved algorithms for generating teams of classifiers, predictors, and similar learning agents with wide applications in a number of fields. More directly, the work will create better identifiers of disordered proteins, a significant problem in its own right.

"The long-term goal of this research is to understand the molecular machinery responsible for the formation of viable pollen grains.  During pollen development, a callose wall is synthesized between the primary cell wall and plasma membrane in the mother cells of pollen and the tetrads of microspores.  Callose is also present in mature pollen grains and is the major component of the pollen tube wall.  Formation of the callose wall is vital for pollen development and male fertility in flowering plants.  Three genetic loci affecting the synthesis of this callose wall have been isolated and characterized in Arabidopsis.  Mutations in these genes result in male sterile phenotypes associated with a common defect in reduced callose deposition during pollen formation.  They encode a microsporogenesis-specific callose synthase (CalS5), a novel Rhomboid-like protease and a receptor-like protein kinase.  The immediate objective of this project is to further characterize the ClaS5 complex and determine whether it is regulated by the protease and protein kinase during pollen formation.  The identification of components of the CalS5 complex and regulation of CalS5 by phosphorylation and proteolytic activation will be studied using both biochemical and proteomic approaches.  Additional genetic loci involved in callose wall synthesis will be identified and characterized using genetic as well as genomic techniques.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The results anticipated from this research will provide significant new insights into mechanisms by which callose synthesis is regulated at the molecular level, and will also advance our understanding of plant reproduction.  This project will add to our understanding of callose synthesis pathways which are not only important in pollen production, but also in host responses to pathogen infection.  At the same time, these studies will give us new insights into the functions of Rhomboid-like proteases and receptor-like kinases which until now, have been poorly characterized in plants.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The proposed project will provide an opportunity to train graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the areas of biochemistry, and cell and developmental biology in plants.  It will also provide a platform to integrate research expertise from other fields and newly developed resources such as glycan arrays into plant research.  The PIs laboratory will actively participate in the University-wide outreach programs, and will accept one to two K-12 students and/or high school science teachers for two weeks to three months during each summer.  This project will also provide excellent training opportunities for undergraduats who take Biochemistry and Plant Biochemistry courses which the PI teaches to participate in GFP-tagged protein localization, and suppressor screens and mapping projects in the PIs laboratory.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.074,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,390000.00,390000,4900,FUNCTIONAL & REGULATORY SYS CL,0543923,,Zonglie Hong,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,zhong@uidaho.edu,Zonglie,Hong,,Mark R.

"Intellectual Merits<br/>Ocean island volcanoes initiate and grow over time periods of 105 to 106 years, requiring a long-lived magmatic plumbing system to transport magma from the mantle to the surface.  Only a fraction of the magma, however, is erupted; magma is stored in crustal magma chambers, or trapped near the crust-mantle boundary.  These magma intrusions grow the crust, and change the state of stress. The increase in pressure accompanying magma intrusion inflates the volcanic edifice, triggering earthquakes and eruptions. The geometry of the magma chambers and conduits, therefore, is fundamental to the development of predictive models of volcano deformation and eruption.<br/>Our integrated seismic and geodetic data acquisition and modelling project aims to image the magma plumbing system beneath the most rapidly deforming hotspot volcano system in the world:  Sierra Negra volcano in the Galapagos Archipelago. Existing SAR data provide high-resolution images of surface deformation over broad regions, and GPS provides continuous time series of vertical and horizontal deformation. We cannot, however, differentiate between the basaltic volcano growth models without complementary seismic information on the distribution and mechanisms of seismic strain, as well as the crust and upper mantle structure. We will deploy and maintain 16 broadband seismometers for two years, recording seismic waves from local and distant earthquakes to illuminate the magmatic plumbing system and state of stress within the lithosphere beneath Sierra Negra volcano to understand the stress interaction between shallow magma intrusion, extrusion, and intra-caldera faulting processes.    <br/>The anticipated results are a new 4D model of Sierra Negra?s shallow and deep magmatic system that satisfies seismic and geodetic observations, and is constrained by earthquake locations, focal mechanisms, wavespeed and ambient noise tomography, seismic anisotropy, receiver function estimates of sill and Moho depths, and existing petrological data. We will determine the time-varying state of stress within and around the volcano in response to magma intrusion and withdrawal, including the dynamic relationship between trapdoor faulting and magma intrusion<br/>Broader Significance and Importance<br/>Ocean island volcanoes initiate and grow over time periods of 105 to 106 years, requiring a long-lived magmatic plumbing system to transport magma from the mantle to the surface.

"Late Cenozoic deformation is broadly distributed across the North American plate margin of the conterminous western United States and stretches from the San Andreas fault system eastward across the Mojave Desert and into the Basin and Range. The eastern California shear zone and Walker Lane of the western Great Basin form an active belt of structures accommodating about 25% of the relative motion between North America and the Pacific plate. From the Mojave Desert, the displacement is carried north, east of the southern Sierra Nevada, in a narrow zone of deformation bound on the west and east by the Owens Valley and Furnace Creek fault systems. North from the latitude of the central Sierra Nevada, the zone of deformation broadens to include the Walker Lane and central<br/>Nevada seismic belt in the northwestern Great Basin. The Sierra Nevada behaves as a coherent tectonic block with a northwest-directed motion of 10-14 mm/yr and forms the western boundary of the zone of distributed deformation in the Great Basin. A complex pattern of active structures underlies west-central Nevada where displacement is transferred from the eastern California shear zone to the Walker Lane and the central Nevada seismic belt. Integrated geologic, seismological, and GPS geodetic results indicate that the central Walker Lane serves as an displacement transfer system linking stepped northwest-trending transcurrent faults. Within the central Walker Lane displacement partitioning is active and may be accommodated by differential motion of tectonic blocks. A GPS velocity field exhibits a systematic increase in magnitude from east to west across the central Walker Lane and is consistent both with block translation and vertical-axis rotation. Zones of divergent, transcurrent, and convergent motion are observed across suspected block boundaries. The observed velocity field is not easily reconciled with the current understanding of fault displacements and points out the difficulty in comparing geodetic and geologic displacement fields.<br/><br/>The PI's propose an integrated geodetic and geologic investigation of the central Walker Lane to address two questions: (1) Is displacement transfer between transcurrent structures wholly accommodated by kinematically coordinated slip on throughgoing faults, and (2) are the kinematics of active displacement transfer derived from GPS geodesy consistent with the displacement field estimated by earthquake seismology and fault-slip inversion? The central Walker Lane is ideally suited for this study for three reasons: (1) the region is seismically active and well defined earthquake focal mechanisms exist for the displacement transfer fault system, (2) the faults are well exposed and have produced preliminary fault-slip estimates of deformation kinematics, and (3) a complex present-day displacement field with ~10 mm/yr of differential slip is recorded by a GPS geodetic network. These elements will allow characterization of the kinematics of displacement transfer and offer the opportunity to directly compare different means of measuring deformation kinematics. The PI's primary interest is to characterize the kinematics of deformation in the active displacement transfer stepover and to compare the geodetically determined displacement field with that derived from earthquake focal mechanisms and fault-slip inversion. To achieve their research objectives, several aspects of the extensional stepover system exposed in the central Walker Lane must be examined in greater detail. The primary tasks set out in this project are: (1) to establish the spatial distribution of active high-angle faults linking the bounding transcurrent faults, (2) to document the detailed geometry and slip history of fault systems that transfer displacement between transcurrent faults, and (3) to deploy a GPS network with sufficient density to differentiate between continuous versus discontinuous variations in the present-day velocity field.<br/>The PI's will address the tasks listed above with an integrated study utilizing detailed geologic mapping, structural analysis, and GPS geodesy. The investigators (Oldow and Satterfield) each have substantial experience working in the area and by building on previous studies, geological mapping and structural analysis will establish the areal limits of the transtensional fault system, document variable geometric relations between major and secondary fault systems, define the kinematic history of fault motion, and develop first-order estimates of recent slip magnitude by documenting offset landforms. Combined with other ongoing or proposed studies in the central Walker Lane, the results of this research should contribute to an unprecedented view of active transtensional displacement transfer and yield critical insight into the comparison of geologic and geodetic measures of deformation kinematics.<br/>",NSF,4900,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,47.050,QWYKRJH5NNJ3,285485.00,285485,4900,Tectonics,0126205,,John S Oldow,875 PERIMETER DR,MOSCOW,US,ID01,Regents of the University of Idaho,ID,838449803,oldow@utdallas.edu,John,Oldow,,Stephen Harlan,,,01/11/2002,01/15/2002,12/31/2005,"Collaborative Research: Geodetic and Geologic Study of the Kinematics of Late Cenozoic Displacement Transfer, Central Walker Lane, Western Great Basin",Standard Grant,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,,S,,
